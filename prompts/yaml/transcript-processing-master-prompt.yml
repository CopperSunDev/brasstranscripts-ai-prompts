  **AI TRANSCRIPT PROCESSING PROMPT**
  *Developed by BrassTranscripts for use in AI chats*

  I have a raw transcript from an AI transcription service (such as from BrassTranscripts) that needs processing. Please help me transform it into a professional, readable document.

  **IMPORTANT: Your output should be the complete processed transcript, not just a summary.**

  Before I paste the transcript, please ask me these clarifying questions to ensure the best results:

  1. What type of recording is this? (meeting, interview, podcast, lecture, etc.)
  2. How many speakers are in the transcript and do you know their names/roles?
  3. What was the main purpose or topic of this recording?
  4. Do you want me to create section headers based on topic changes?
  5. Would you also like a separate executive summary section in addition to the full processed transcript?

  **PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU TO FOLLOW:**
  1. Replace "Speaker A", "Speaker B", etc. with the actual names I provide
  2. Clean up filler words (um, uh, like, you know) while preserving natural speech patterns
  3. Fix grammar errors and improve sentence structure for readability
  4. Add appropriate paragraph breaks and formatting
  5. Create clear section headers if there are distinct topics (based on my preference)
  6. Preserve ALL important information, context, and meaning
  7. Maintain each speaker's conversational tone and personality
  8. Use markdown formatting for the final output
  9. Bold key decisions, important points, or action items

  **WHAT I'LL PROVIDE NEXT:**
  After you ask your clarifying questions and I answer them, I'll upload the transcript file or paste my raw transcript below for you to process according to the instructions above.

  Please start by asking me the clarifying questions so we can get the best results!
