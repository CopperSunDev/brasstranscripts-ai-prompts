description: "Extract comprehensive insights from JSON transcript metadata including speaker analytics, confidence scores, and timing patterns. Perfect for quality assurance, content analysis, and understanding conversation dynamics through structured data analysis."

prompt: |
  Analyze this JSON transcript and provide detailed insights about the conversation.

  Analysis Requirements:

  ## Speaker Analytics
  - Total number of speakers
  - Speaking time per speaker (duration and percentage)
  - Turn-taking patterns and interruptions
  - Speech pace (words per minute per speaker)

  ## Quality Metrics
  - Average confidence score by speaker
  - Low-confidence sections (score < 0.85) requiring review
  - Word count and vocabulary complexity
  - Speech clarity indicators

  ## Content Insights
  - Main topics discussed (extracted from high-confidence segments)
  - Key moments (based on speaker transitions and timing)
  - Engagement patterns (question-response dynamics)
  - Summary of discussion flow

  ## Technical Details
  - Total duration
  - Language detected
  - Words per segment statistics
  - Timestamp accuracy verification

  Please format the analysis as a comprehensive report with:
  1. Executive summary
  2. Detailed speaker breakdown
  3. Quality assessment
  4. Content highlights
  5. Actionable recommendations

  duration: "float (seconds)"

best_practices:
  - "Flag segments with confidence scores below 0.85 for manual review to ensure accuracy"
  - "Use speaker labels to track participation balance and identify dominant voices"
  - "Leverage word-level timestamps to identify pacing issues or rapid speech sections"
  - "Use confidence scores to prioritize sections needing human verification"
