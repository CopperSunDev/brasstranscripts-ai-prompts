  PROJECT DETAILS:
  - Total number of interviews: [NUMBER]
  - Average interview length: [MINUTES]
  - Interview format: [IN-PERSON / PHONE / VIDEO CALL]
  - Number of participants per interview: [NUMBER]
  - Do I need verbatim transcription? [YES/NO]

  - Total project cost (transcription + review time)
  - Timeline feasibility
  - Risk factors (accuracy for technical content, speaker attribution reliability)

  PROVIDE:
  - Recommended approach for my budget and timeline
  - What I'd sacrifice by choosing the cheapest option
