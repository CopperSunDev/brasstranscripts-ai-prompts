prompt_text: |
  I need help choosing between transcription services based on my usage patterns. Please analyze which option (pay-per-file or subscription) would be more cost-effective and practical for my needs.

  My Transcription Usage:
  - Average minutes transcribed per month: [YOUR NUMBER]
  - Typical file length: [e.g., 30 minutes, 90 minutes, 2 hours]
  - Usage consistency: [e.g., "Every week", "2-3 times per month", "Varies significantly"]
  - Content type: [e.g., Podcasts, Meetings, Interviews, Lectures, Mixed]
  - Team size: [Solo / 2-5 people / 6+ people]

  Required Features:
  - [ ] Real-time live transcription
  - [ ] Speaker identification
  - [ ] Subtitle file formats (SRT/VTT)
  - [ ] AI summarization
  - [ ] Team collaboration
  - [ ] Multi-language support (specify languages: [YOUR LANGUAGES])
  - [ ] Integration with other tools (specify: [YOUR TOOLS])

  Budget Information:
  - Current monthly transcription spending: $[YOUR AMOUNT] or [FREE/TRIAL currently]
  - Maximum monthly budget: $[YOUR MAXIMUM]
  - Billing preference: [Monthly subscription / Pay-per-use / Either works]

  Based on this information:

  1. Calculate my monthly costs for both BrassTranscripts (pay-per-file at $2.25 for 1-15 min, $0.15/min for 16+ min) and typical subscription services (assume ~$20-50/month for mid-tier)

  2. Identify which features I actually need vs. nice-to-have extras

  3. Recommend which pricing model makes more sense for my usage pattern

  4. Highlight any dealbreakers or must-have features that eliminate options

  5. Suggest whether I should start with a trial/free option or commit to paid service immediately

  Please show your math and reasoning for cost calculations.
