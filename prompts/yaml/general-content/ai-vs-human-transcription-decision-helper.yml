prompt_text: |
  I need help deciding whether to use AI transcription (BrassTranscripts) or human transcription (Rev) for my project.

  Project details:
  - **Content type**: [Specify what you're transcribing, e.g., "podcast interviews" or "legal depositions" or "research interviews" or "business meetings"]
  - **Audio quality**: [Specify typical quality, e.g., "clear studio recording" or "phone call with background noise" or "conference room with multiple speakers"]
  - **Speaker characteristics**: [Specify, e.g., "native English speakers, clear diction" or "heavy accents" or "technical jargon" or "medical terminology"]
  - **Volume**: [Specify amount, e.g., "5 hours total" or "20 hours monthly ongoing"]
  - **Accuracy requirements**: [Specify needs, e.g., "rough draft for editing" or "court-admissible transcript" or "publication-ready quotes"]
  - **Timeline**: [Specify urgency, e.g., "same-day turnaround needed" or "1-week deadline acceptable"]
  - **Use case**: [Specify purpose, e.g., "blog post source material" or "legal evidence" or "medical records" or "content creation"]
  - **Budget**: [Specify constraints, e.g., "$200 total budget" or "unlimited for compliance" or "tight academic budget"]

  Please analyze my project and provide:

  1. **Primary recommendation** (AI, human, or hybrid approach) with specific reasoning
  2. **Cost comparison** showing total project cost for AI vs. human options
  3. **Accuracy expectations** for my specific audio type and quality
  4. **Risk assessment** if choosing the more affordable option (what could go wrong?)
  5. **Hybrid strategy** if applicable (e.g., AI for some parts, human for others)
  6. **Quality assurance approach** to maximize accuracy regardless of choice
  7. **Deal-breakers** - specific scenarios where I should absolutely choose one over the other

  Be honest about trade-offs. If human transcription is genuinely necessary for my use case, explain why the 10Ã— cost is justified. If AI is sufficient, explain what quality checks I should implement.
