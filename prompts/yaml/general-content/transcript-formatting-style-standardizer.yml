prompt_template: |
  I have a raw AI-generated transcript that needs professional formatting and style standardization. Please help me apply consistent rules and formatting throughout the document:

  **Current Transcript:**
  [PASTE YOUR TRANSCRIPT HERE]

  **Formatting Requirements:**
  - Style preference: [Clean read / Verbatim / Intelligent verbatim]
  - Number formatting: [Spell out 1-9, numerals 10+ / All numerals / All spelled out]
  - Time format: [12-hour with AM/PM / 24-hour / Spelled out]
  - Speaker label format: [Full names / "Speaker 1,2,3" / Role titles]
  - Timestamp frequency: [Every paragraph / Every 30 seconds / None / Custom]

  Please standardize the following throughout the transcript:

  1. **Speaker Labels**
     - Apply consistent format for all speaker identifications
     - Place labels on separate lines before dialogue
     - Ensure no mid-sentence label interruptions

  2. **Grammar and Punctuation**
     - Add proper sentence-ending punctuation
     - Insert commas for natural reading flow (not based on pauses)
     - Correct obvious grammatical errors while preserving speaker voice
     - Apply consistent capitalization rules

  3. **Number and Time Formatting**
     - Standardize all number representations per style guide
     - Format all time references consistently
     - Add commas to large numbers (1,000 not 1000)

  4. **Content Notation**
     - Mark inaudible sections as [inaudible HH:MM:SS]
     - Indicate unclear content as [unclear] or [unclear: best guess?]
     - Note significant non-speech sounds: [laughter], [phone rings]
     - Handle simultaneous speech: [speaking simultaneously]

  5. **Technical Terms and Acronyms**
     - Spell out acronyms on first use: Full Name (ACRONYM)
     - Use acronym alone in subsequent references
     - Verify technical term spellings and correct if needed
     - Flag uncertain terminology for manual review

  6. **Remove or Clean**
     - Remove excessive filler words ("um," "uh," "like") if clean read style
     - Eliminate false starts and repeated words unless verbatim required
     - Clean up run-on sentences into proper sentence structure
     - Remove irrelevant background conversation or noise

  7. **Consistency Checks**
     - Ensure consistent spelling of names, companies, products throughout
     - Verify consistent terminology (don't alternate between synonyms)
     - Apply consistent paragraph breaks at logical conversation points
     - Maintain consistent tense and voice

  Please return the fully formatted transcript with all standardizations applied, and provide a brief summary of major changes made (e.g., "Corrected 47 instances of inconsistent speaker labels, standardized 23 number formats, removed 156 filler words").

example_input: "Raw 60-minute meeting transcript with inconsistent speaker labels, mixed number formatting, and 200+ filler words, requiring clean read style with AP Style number formatting"

example_output: |
  **Formatted Transcript - Board Meeting - October 29, 2025**

  John Smith (CEO): Good morning, everyone. Let's start with Q4 results. Revenue reached $1.2 million, exceeding our target by 15%.

  Sarah Johnson (CFO): That's correct. We saw strong performance in three key areas: enterprise sales increased 23%, recurring revenue grew to $850,000 annually, and customer acquisition costs decreased to $1,200 per customer.

  [phone rings in background]

  John Smith (CEO): [pauses for phone] As I was saying, this positions us well for next quarter.

  **Changes Applied:**
  - Standardized 47 speaker labels (removed mid-sentence switches)

  - Removed 156 filler words ("um," "uh," "like")
  - Added 89 punctuation marks for proper sentence structure

  - "Sample review: After first use, review a sample section to verify formatting matches expectations before processing full document"
  - "Save preferences: Document your style choices for consistent formatting across multiple transcripts"
