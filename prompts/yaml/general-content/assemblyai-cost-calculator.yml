  Calculate the TRUE total cost of using AssemblyAI including all hidden fees and pricing complexity.
  Calculate TRUE AssemblyAI costs with feature explosion model - base transcription plus individual pricing for speaker ID, sentiment analysis, entity detection, topic detection, summarization, and PII redaction.

prompt: |
  Calculate my TRUE AssemblyAI costs including all hidden fees:

  **My Usage:**
  - Monthly audio volume: [X hours, e.g., "50 hours"]
  - Need speaker identification: [Yes/No]
  - Primary use case: [Podcasts/Meetings/Interviews/Other]
  - Average file length: [X minutes]
  - Number of files per month: [X files]

  **Please Calculate:**

  1. **Base AssemblyAI cost** (include all tier/model options)
  2. **Add-on feature costs** (speaker ID, sentiment, etc.)
  3. **Infrastructure/setup costs** (if applicable)
  4. **Hidden fees** (minimums, regional pricing, etc.)
  5. **Total monthly cost** (all fees included)

  **Then Compare:**
  - **AssemblyAI TOTAL** (all fees included)
  - **BrassTranscripts cost** ($0.15/min all-inclusive, $2.25 for 0-15 min)

  Show me:
  - Which service is cheaper for MY specific usage
  - Break-even point if volume changes
  - Hidden costs I might not know about
  - When BrassTranscripts' all-inclusive pricing becomes better value

  Be specific with dollar amounts and show the math.
