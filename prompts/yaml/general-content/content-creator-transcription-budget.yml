  Plan transcription budgets for content creators with variable production schedules.
  Calculates costs across slow, average, and busy month scenarios to identify services
  that handle production variability without wasting money on unused subscription capacity.

prompt: |
  Plan my transcription budget as a content creator with variable output.

  MY CONTENT PRODUCTION:
  - Primary platform: [YOUTUBE/PODCAST/COURSES/MIXED]
  - Content pieces per month: [RANGE, e.g., "2-6"]
  - Average content length: [MINUTES]
  - Busiest month (last year): [PIECES] pieces, [TOTAL HOURS] audio
  - Slowest month (last year): [PIECES] pieces, [TOTAL HOURS] audio

  WHAT I USE TRANSCRIPTS FOR:
  - [ ] YouTube captions/subtitles
  - [ ] Blog post creation
  - [ ] Social media quotes
  - [ ] Show notes
  - [ ] Course materials
  - [ ] SEO optimization
  - [ ] Accessibility compliance

  CALCULATE THREE SCENARIOS:

  **Scenario A: Slow Month**
  - Minimum expected content
  - Calculate costs across services

  **Scenario B: Average Month**
  - Typical content volume
  - Calculate costs across services

  **Scenario C: Busy Month**
  - Maximum expected content
  - Calculate costs across services

  FOR EACH SCENARIO, COMPARE:
  1. BrassTranscripts (pay-per-use): $6/file over 15 min
  2. Otter Pro ($16.99/mo): 1,200 min included
  3. Descript Creator ($15/mo): 10 hours included
  4. Descript Pro ($30/mo): 30 hours included

  ANALYSIS:
  - Which service wins in each scenario?
  - What's my expected annual cost with variable production?
  - At what consistent volume does subscription beat pay-per-use?
  - Hidden costs for my specific use cases (SRT export, speaker ID, etc.)

  RECOMMENDATION:
  - Best primary service for my variability pattern
  - Backup option for overflow months
  - Annual budget range to plan for
