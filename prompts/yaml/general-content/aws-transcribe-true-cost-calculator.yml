prompt_text: |
  Calculate my TRUE AWS Transcribe costs including all hidden fees:

  **My Usage:**
  - Monthly audio volume: [X hours, e.g., "50 hours"]
  - Audio format: [MP3/WAV/other]
  - Need speaker identification: [Yes/No]
  - Need custom vocabulary: [Yes/No]
  - AWS region: [US East/Europe/Asia Pacific/other]
  - Average file length: [X minutes]
  - Number of files per month: [X files]
  - Storage duration needed: [X months]

  **Please Calculate:**

  1. **Base AWS Transcribe cost** by tier (include tier breakdown)
  2. **Speaker identification fees** (if applicable)
  3. **S3 storage costs** ($0.023/GB/month)
  4. **Data transfer costs** (if applicable)
  5. **Regional pricing adjustment** (if outside US East)
  6. **15-second minimum impact** (if many short files)
  7. **Custom vocabulary fees** (if applicable)

  **Then Compare:**
  - **AWS Transcribe TOTAL** (all fees included)
  - **BrassTranscripts cost** ($0.15/min all-inclusive, $2.25 for 0-15 min)

  Show me:
  - Which service is cheaper for MY specific usage
  - Break-even point if volume changes
  - Hidden costs I might not know about
  - When BrassTranscripts' all-inclusive pricing becomes better value

  Be specific with dollar amounts and show the math.
