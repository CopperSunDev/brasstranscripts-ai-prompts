  Conduct systematic thematic analysis of qualitative research interviews following structured coding phases. This prompt guides AI through formal thematic analysis methodology—initial coding, theme development, theme review, and analytical insights—providing researchers with preliminary analysis that follows qualitative research best practices.

prompt: |
  Conduct a thematic analysis of this qualitative research interview following systematic coding principles.

  Research Context:
  - Study focus: [RESEARCH TOPIC]
  - Research questions: [PRIMARY QUESTIONS]
  - Participant: [DEMOGRAPHIC INFO - ANONYMIZED]
  - Methodological approach: [GROUNDED THEORY / PHENOMENOLOGY / ETC]

  Analysis Requirements:

  ## Phase 1: Initial Coding
  - Read through the entire transcript
  - Identify meaningful segments related to research questions
  - Generate initial descriptive codes for significant statements
  - Note any surprising or unexpected responses

  ## Phase 2: Theme Development
  - Group related codes into potential themes
  - Identify patterns and relationships between codes
  - Develop theme names that capture essential meanings
  - Provide representative quotes for each theme

  ## Phase 3: Theme Review
  For each identified theme, provide:
  1. Theme name and brief definition
  2. 2-3 representative quotes with context
  3. How this theme relates to research questions
  4. Connections to other themes
  5. Preliminary interpretation

  ## Phase 4: Analytical Insights
  - Contradictions or tensions within the data
  - Participant's unique perspective or experiences
  - Concepts requiring further exploration in future interviews
  - Methodological notes (unclear responses, topic saturation, etc.)

  Formatting Requirements:
  - Use participant's own language in theme names when possible
  - Maintain confidentiality (use pseudonyms, remove identifying details)
  - Include line numbers or timestamps for quote references
  - Note emotional content or significant pauses if relevant to interpretation

use_cases:
  - Dissertation research systematic analysis of participant interviews
  - Academic research projects following formal qualitative methodologies
  - Grant-funded studies requiring rigorous thematic analysis
  - Mixed-methods research qualitative component analysis
  - Phenomenological research theme identification

best_practices:
  - Use AI output as preliminary analysis only - researcher must validate all themes
  - Review each phase independently rather than accepting full output wholesale
  - Verify codes before progressing to theme development
  - Document AI assistance in methodology sections when reporting findings
  - Combine with manual coding for methodological rigor
  - Iterate through multiple coding cycles with human oversight

example_output: |
  **Phase 1: Initial Coding**
  - Code: "financial stress impact on academics" (Lines 45-52)
  - Code: "hidden curriculum navigation" (Lines 78-91)
  - Code: "peer support as critical resource" (Lines 134-147)

  **Phase 2: Theme Development**
  Theme: "Navigating Institutional Barriers"
  - Related codes: hidden curriculum, access to resources, unspoken norms

  **Phase 3: Theme Review**
  **Theme 1: Navigating Hidden Curriculum Without Guidance**
  Definition: Participants struggled with unspoken academic norms
  Quotes:
  1. "Everyone else seemed to know what office hours were for..." (Line 48)
  2. "I didn't even know what a syllabus was..." (Line 79)
  Research connection: Relates to RQ1 about first-generation student challenges

  **Phase 4: Analytical Insights**
  Contradiction: Pride in independence vs. acknowledgment of need for support
  Unique perspective: Distinction between economic and cultural class barriers
  Further exploration: Specific institutional interventions and their effectiveness

tips:
  - Provide comprehensive research context for more relevant coding
  - Use participant pseudonyms consistently throughout
  - Reference line numbers or timestamps for all quotes
  - Conduct multiple analysis passes rather than single iteration
  - Compare AI-generated themes with manual coding for validation
  - Use this as starting point for deeper interpretive analysis
