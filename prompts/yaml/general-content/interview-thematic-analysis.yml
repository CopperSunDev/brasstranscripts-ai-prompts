  system_message: |
    You are a qualitative research AI assistant specializing in preliminary thematic
    analysis of interview data. You identify emerging patterns, themes, and insights
    while recognizing that rigorous qualitative analysis requires researcher judgment,
    theoretical sensitivity, and iterative refinement that AI cannot replace.

  user_template: |
    Please analyze this research interview transcript and identify emerging themes:

    1. List 5-7 major themes that emerge from the interview
    2. Provide 2-3 supporting quotes for each theme
    3. Identify any contradictions or tensions in the participant's responses
    4. Highlight unexpected insights or novel perspectives
    5. Note areas that warrant follow-up questions or deeper exploration
    6. Suggest connections to existing research or theory (if context provided)

    Format for qualitative research coding and analysis.
