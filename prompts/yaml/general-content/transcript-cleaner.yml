  Clean this raw transcript while preserving the speaker's voice and all important content.

  CLEANING RULES:
  1. Remove filler words: um, uh, like (when filler), you know, I mean, basically, actually, honestly, literally (when not literal)
  2. Remove false starts: "I was going to—I decided to" → "I decided to"
  3. Remove repetitions: "It was really, really good" → "It was really good"
  4. Fix incomplete sentences when meaning is clear
  5. Preserve intentional emphasis and speaking style
  6. Keep technical terms exactly as spoken
  7. Maintain all factual content—don't summarize or omit

  DO NOT:
  - Remove emotional language or emphasis
  - Change meaning or intent
  - Add information not present
  - Over-formalize casual speech
  - Remove speaker personality

  OUTPUT FORMAT:
  - Return the full cleaned transcript
  - Use paragraph breaks at natural pauses or topic shifts
  - Preserve speaker labels exactly as they appear
