prompt_template: |
  Replace speaker labels in this transcript with the correct names based on the context I provide.

  SPEAKER INFORMATION:
  - Speaker A is: [NAME AND ROLE]
  - Speaker B is: [NAME AND ROLE]
  - Speaker C is: [NAME AND ROLE]
  (Add more as needed)

  IF SPEAKERS AREN'T IDENTIFIED:
  - Analyze speaking patterns to suggest likely roles
  - Note: "Based on question patterns, Speaker A appears to be the interviewer"
  - Label by role if names unknown: "Interviewer:", "Guest:", "Host:"

  LABELING RULES:
  1. Replace ALL instances of "Speaker A/B/C" with provided names
  2. Use consistent format: "Name:" at start of each speaking turn
  3. Preserve all original content exactly
  4. Note any speakers who couldn't be confidently identified

  OUTPUT FORMAT:
  - Full transcript with corrected speaker labels
  - If any speakers unclear, add note at the top explaining assumptions
