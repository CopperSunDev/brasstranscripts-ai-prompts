description: |
  Calculate accurate AI transcription processing times for BrassTranscripts and understand realistic delivery expectations for your audio files. Helps with deadline planning, workflow optimization, and managing client expectations.

prompt: |
  Calculate my AI transcription processing time:

  **My Files:**
  - Total audio duration: [X hours and X minutes, e.g., "2 hours 30 minutes"]
  - Number of files: [X files]
  - Average file length: [X minutes per file]
  - Upload method: [Single file / Multiple files in sequence]

  **BrassTranscripts Processing Guidelines:**
  - Processing speed: 1-3 minutes per hour of audio
  - Typical processing time: ~2 minutes per hour of audio
  - Files process sequentially (one at a time if uploading multiple)

  **Please Calculate:**

  1. **Per-file processing time**
     - Fast estimate (1 min/hour of audio)
     - Typical estimate (2 min/hour of audio)
     - Conservative estimate (3 min/hour of audio)

  2. **Total processing time**
     - If uploading all files at once (sequential processing)
     - If uploading files one-by-one (includes my upload time)

  3. **Timeline with buffer**
     - Add recommended time buffer for safety
     - Suggested "delivery by" time if I upload now

  **Then provide:**
  - **Realistic deadline**: When I can expect all transcripts
  - **Buffer recommendation**: How much extra time to allow
  - **Workflow tips**: Best practices for my specific scenario

  Be specific with time estimates and show the math.

input_variables:
  - name: total_audio_duration
    required: true
    type: string
    example: "5 hours 45 minutes"
    purpose: Determines total processing time calculation

  - name: number_of_files
    required: true
    type: integer
    example: 12
    purpose: Helps understand sequential processing implications

  - name: average_file_length
    required: true
    type: string
    example: "30 minutes per file"
    purpose: Allows per-file time estimates

  - name: upload_method
    required: true
    type: string
    example: "Multiple files in sequence"
    purpose: Determines if sequential processing delay applies
