prompt_text: |
  I need help choosing the most cost-effective transcription service for my needs.

  My transcription requirements:
  - **Monthly volume**: [Specify hours per month, e.g., "5-8 hours monthly" or "varies between 2-20 hours"]
  - **Usage pattern**: [Specify consistency, e.g., "consistent every month" or "sporadic - heavy some months, light others"]
  - **Audio quality**: [Specify typical quality, e.g., "clear studio recordings" or "conference calls with background noise"]
  - **Accuracy requirements**: [Specify needs, e.g., "95%+ for blog content" or "99%+ for legal depositions"]
  - **Turnaround needs**: [Specify timing, e.g., "same-day preferred" or "24-48 hours acceptable"]
  - **Budget constraints**: [Specify limits, e.g., "$50/month maximum" or "willing to pay premium for quality"]
  - **Additional features**: [Specify needs, e.g., "need SRT captions" or "multi-language support" or "speaker identification"]

  Please analyze my requirements and recommend:

  1. **Primary service recommendation** with specific reasoning based on my usage pattern
  2. **Cost calculation** showing expected monthly costs based on my volume
  3. **Alternative options** if my usage patterns change (lighter or heavier months)
  4. **Cost-saving strategies** specific to my needs (batching, format optimization, volume discounts)
  5. **Hidden costs to watch for** based on the services you recommend
  6. **Hybrid approach** if combining multiple services would save money

  Compare at least 3 services and show the math on why your recommendation is most cost-effective for my specific situation, not just the lowest per-minute rate.
