  The meta-calculator for transcription pricing decisions. Analyzes usage history,
  calculates subscription utilization rates, and determines whether subscription or
  pay-per-use pricing minimizes total cost based on actual usage patterns.

prompt: |
  Help me decide: should I subscribe to a transcription service or pay per use?

  MY USAGE HISTORY (be honest):
  - Transcription hours last 3 months: [MONTH1], [MONTH2], [MONTH3]
  - Expected hours next 3 months: [MONTH1], [MONTH2], [MONTH3]
  - Highest single month ever: [HOURS]
  - Lowest single month ever: [HOURS]
  - How predictable is my usage? [VERY/SOMEWHAT/UNPREDICTABLE]

  SUBSCRIPTION OPTIONS I'M CONSIDERING:
  1. [SERVICE]: $[PRICE]/month for [MINUTES] minutes
  2. [SERVICE]: $[PRICE]/month for [MINUTES] minutes

  PAY-PER-USE BASELINE:
  - BrassTranscripts: $6/hour (files over 15 min)

  CALCULATE:

  **Utilization Analysis**
  - Average monthly usage: [calculate from history]
  - Usage variability: [standard deviation or range]
  - Subscription utilization rate: [% of included minutes I'd actually use]

  **Cost Comparison**
  - Subscription annual cost: [fixed]
  - Pay-per-use annual cost: [based on actual usage pattern]
  - Effective per-hour rate for each option

  **Break-Even Analysis**
  - Hours/month where subscription becomes cheaper
  - How often do I actually hit that threshold?

  **Risk Assessment**
  - Cost of unused subscription capacity
  - Cost of pay-per-use in high-volume months
  - Which risk is more expensive for my pattern?

  DECISION FRAMEWORK:
  - If utilization would be >80%: Subscription likely wins
  - If utilization would be 50-80%: Calculate carefully
  - If utilization would be <50%: Pay-per-use likely wins
  - If usage is highly variable: Pay-per-use reduces risk

  RECOMMENDATION:
  - Clear recommendation with reasoning
  - What would change my recommendation
  - Suggested review period (when to recalculate)
