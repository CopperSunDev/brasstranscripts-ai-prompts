    Review this medical transcript for terminology accuracy and flag any potential transcription errors that could affect patient care:

    **TERMINOLOGY REVIEW**

    **Medication Names:**
    Check all mentioned medications for:
    - Correct spelling and generic/brand name accuracy
    - Dosage information clarity
    - Route of administration (oral, IV, topical, etc.)
    - Frequency instructions
    - Flag any unclear or potentially misheard drug names

    **Medical Conditions:**
    Verify accuracy of:
    - Disease and condition names
    - Anatomical terms
    - Symptom descriptions
    - Diagnostic terminology
    - Procedure names

    **Critical Values:**
    Review for accuracy:
    - Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature)
    - Laboratory values
    - Measurement units (mg, mL, mmHg, etc.)
    - Percentages and ranges
    - Time-sensitive information

    **SAFETY FLAGS**
    Identify any sections where transcription errors could impact:
    - Patient safety (medication dosing, allergy information)
    - Continuity of care (follow-up instructions, specialist referrals)
    - Legal documentation (patient consent, procedure risks)
    - Billing accuracy (procedure codes, diagnosis clarity)

    **RECOMMENDATIONS**
    For each flagged item, provide:
    - Most likely correct terminology based on medical context
    - Confidence level in the correction (high/medium/low)
    - Suggestion to verify with provider if uncertainty remains
    - Alternative transcription possibilities if multiple options exist

    Focus on clinical accuracy over perfect grammar. Medical communication often includes abbreviated forms and professional shorthand that should be preserved if clinically clear.
