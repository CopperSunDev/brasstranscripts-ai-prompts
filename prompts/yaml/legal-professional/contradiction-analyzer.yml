  ## Internal Consistency Analysis

  **Direct Contradictions Within Testimony:**
  For each contradiction identified:
  - **Contradiction #[Number]:**
  - **Page/Line References:** [Specific transcript locations]
  - **Statement A:** "[Exact quote with page/line reference]"
  - **Statement B:** "[Conflicting quote with page/line reference]"
  - **Nature of Conflict:** [What specifically conflicts]
  - **Potential Significance:** [Why this matters for the case]
  - **Follow-up Questions Suggested:** [How to explore this further]

  **Timeline Inconsistencies:**
  - **Event:** [What happened]
  - **Conflicting Timeframes:** [Different times/dates mentioned]
  - **References:** [Page/line numbers for each version]
  - **Clarification Needed:** [What questions would resolve this]

  **Factual Discrepancies:**
  - **Topic:** [Subject matter in question]
  - **Inconsistent Details:** [What doesn't align]
  - **Supporting Evidence Needed:** [Documents or testimony to verify]

  ## Credibility Assessment Factors

  **Memory-Related Issues:**
  - Instances of "I don't remember" vs. detailed recollection patterns
  - Conveniently forgotten details about crucial events
  - Overly precise memory about favorable facts vs. vague memory about unfavorable facts

  **Bias Indicators:**
  - Language patterns showing favoritism or hostility
  - Inconsistent levels of detail based on which party benefits
  - Defensive responses to specific questioning areas

  **Coaching or Preparation Indicators:**
  - Rehearsed-sounding responses
  - Unusual terminology or legal language from lay witnesses
  - Consistent framing that benefits one party's narrative

  ## Strategic Analysis

  **Strongest Contradictions for Cross-Examination:**
  1. **Priority #1:** [Most damaging contradiction]
     - **Impact:** [How this affects case theory]
     - **Proof Required:** [Evidence needed to support]
     - **Cross-Examination Approach:** [How to present this effectively]

  2. **Priority #2:** [Second most significant contradiction]
     - **Impact:** [Case significance]
     - **Corroborating Evidence:** [Additional support needed]

  **Areas Requiring Additional Investigation:**
  - **Investigative Need:** [What needs to be explored]
  - **Potential Sources:** [Where to find clarifying information]
  - **Timeline for Discovery:** [When this must be completed]

  ## Documentation Recommendations

  **Exhibit Preparation:**
  - Timeline charts showing conflicting statements
  - Side-by-side comparison documents for major contradictions
  - Reference guides for quick access during cross-examination

  **Deposition Summary:**
  - Executive summary of key contradictions for legal team review
  - Witness credibility assessment for settlement discussions
  - Strategic recommendations for case development

  Please maintain exact quote accuracy and provide specific page/line references for all citations. Flag any areas where the transcript quality affects analysis confidence.

  ### Internal Consistency Analysis

  **Contradiction #1:**
  - **Page/Line References:** Page 47/Lines 12-15 vs. Page 112/Lines 3-8
  - **Statement A:** "I never discussed the contract terms with Mr. Johnson before signing" (Page 47/Lines 12-15)
  - **Statement B:** "Mr. Johnson and I went over several concerns about the payment schedule during our lunch meeting" (Page 112/Lines 3-8)
  - **Nature of Conflict:** Direct contradiction about whether contract discussions occurred
  - **Potential Significance:** Undermines witness credibility and supports opposing party's claim of informed consent
  - **Follow-up Questions Suggested:** "When did this lunch meeting occur?" "What specific concerns were discussed?" "Why didn't you mention this discussion earlier?"

  **Timeline Inconsistency:**
  - **Event:** Contract signing meeting
  - **Conflicting Timeframes:** "Early morning, around 9 AM" (Page 23) vs. "After lunch, probably 2 PM" (Page 89)
  - **References:** Page 23/Line 7 and Page 89/Lines 14-16
  - **Clarification Needed:** Exact time of meeting to verify attendance of other parties

  ### Credibility Assessment Factors

  **Memory-Related Issues:**
  - Witness claims "I don't remember" 23 times regarding events unfavorable to their position
  - Provides detailed recollection of conversations that support their case (down to specific phrases)
  - Cannot recall receiving important documents but remembers precise wording of oral agreements

best_practices:
  - "Verification priority: Always verify AI-identified contradictions by reviewing the original transcript and audio when possible"
  - "Context consideration: Analyze contradictions within the full context of questioning to ensure they're not simply clarifications or corrections"
  - "Evidence correlation: Cross-reference identified contradictions with physical evidence, documents, and other witness testimony"
  - "Strategic prioritization: Focus on contradictions that directly impact your case theory or the opposing party's key arguments"
