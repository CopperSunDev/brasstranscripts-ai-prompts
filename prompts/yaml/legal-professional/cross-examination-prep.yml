  ## Cross-Examination Framework Development

  **Witness Assessment Profile:**
  - **Credibility Strengths:** [Areas where witness appears credible]

  ### Witness Assessment Profile

  **Credibility Strengths:**
  - Witness appears confident and knowledgeable about technical contract details
  - Provides specific dates and times for most events
  - Admits uncertainty when genuinely unsure rather than guessing

  **Credibility Weaknesses:**
  - Memory becomes vague when discussing events unfavorable to their position
  - Defensive and evasive when questioned about financial motivations
  - Multiple contradictions between current testimony and prior statements

  ### Strategic Cross-Examination Topic #1: Contract Terms Discussion

  **Objective:** Establish that witness had detailed knowledge of contract terms despite claiming ignorance

  **Question Sequence:**

  1. **Foundation Questions:**
     - "You testified that you have 15 years of experience in contract negotiations, correct?" (Page 12/Lines 4-6)
     - "And you've personally reviewed hundreds of contracts in your career?" (Page 13/Lines 8-10)

  2. **Commitment Questions:**
     - "You told us earlier that you never discussed the payment terms with anyone before signing, is that right?" (Page 47/Lines 12-15)
     - "You're certain there were no conversations about payment schedules?" (Page 48/Lines 2-4)

  3. **Contradiction/Challenge Questions:**
     - "But you also testified that you and Mr. Johnson discussed 'several concerns about the payment schedule during your lunch meeting,' didn't you?" (Page 112/Lines 3-8)
     - Evidence to Present: Timeline exhibit showing lunch meeting occurred before contract signing

best_practices:
  - "Preparation depth: Use AI analysis as foundation, but supplement with thorough manual review and case law research"
  - "Flexibility maintenance: Prepare for witness variations from deposition testimony and have contingency questions ready"
  - "Evidence integration: Coordinate cross-examination strategy with exhibit presentation and overall case narrative"
  - "Professional standards: Maintain ethical boundaries and courtroom decorum while pursuing vigorous advocacy"
