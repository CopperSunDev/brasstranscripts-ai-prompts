    [Strategic Planning Meeting]
    CFO: I'm concerned about our concentration risk. Three major clients represent 65% of our revenue.

    CEO: Yes, and Client A mentioned they're evaluating alternatives due to budget pressures.

    Sales Director: The new competitor entered our market with 20% lower pricing. We're seeing some client inquiries about their services.

    Operations: Our legacy billing system integration is behind schedule. If it's not ready by Q1, we'll have manual processes that could cause service disruptions.

    CFO: That could impact our SLA compliance and potentially trigger penalty clauses.
