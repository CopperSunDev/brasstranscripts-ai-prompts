    Review this interview transcript for potential bias indicators and documentation quality.

    Analyze the following:

    1. **Question Consistency**
       - Were job-related questions asked consistently?
       - Any off-topic questions that could indicate bias?
       - Questions about protected characteristics (even if indirect)?

    2. **Evaluation Quality**
       - Are there statements about the candidate's "culture fit" without job-related basis?
       - Any comments based on appearance, background, or demographics?
       - Assumptions made without evidence from candidate responses?

    3. **Documentation Gaps**
       - Important candidate statements that weren't explored further
       - Competencies that weren't adequately assessed
       - Missing follow-up questions that would strengthen evaluation

    4. **Bias Risk Indicators**
       - Affinity bias signals (similarity to interviewer)
       - Confirmation bias patterns (seeking information that confirms initial impression)
       - Attribution errors (assumptions based on external traits)

    5. **Recommendations**
       - Documentation improvements needed
       - Additional evaluation steps required
       - Training opportunities for interviewers

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    - Risk level: [Low/Medium/High]
    - Priority issues to address
    - Suggested remediation steps
