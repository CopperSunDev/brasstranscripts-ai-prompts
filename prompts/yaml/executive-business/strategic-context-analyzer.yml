  input_sample: |
    [Strategic Planning Meeting]
    CEO: Our customer retention has dropped to 85%. We need to investigate a loyalty program.

    CMO: The competitor launched theirs last quarter and saw 12% improvement. Initial research shows customers want rewards.

    CFO: What's the investment? We have $200K in the retention budget, but we'd need to reallocate from paid ads.

    VP Product: We'd need 2 engineers for Q1, plus CRM integration. But the CLV increase could be substantial.

    Head of Sales: Our enterprise customers specifically asked about loyalty benefits. This could differentiate us.

    CEO: Let's model the ROI. If we increase retention to 90%, what's the revenue impact?

    CFO: At 15% CLV increase, that's $2.4M annually. 12x return on investment.

    - **Revenue opportunities**: $2.4M annually from 15% CLV increase
    - **ROI considerations**: 12x return on investment calculated and discussed

    **Resource Allocation Decisions:**
