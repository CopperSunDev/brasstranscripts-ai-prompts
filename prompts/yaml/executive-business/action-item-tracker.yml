    ## Action Item Registry

    For each task identified, create an entry with:

    **Action #[Number]**
    - **Task Description:** [Clear, specific deliverable]
    - **Assigned To:** [Person or team responsible]
    - **Due Date:** [Specific date or "within X days/weeks"]
    - **Success Criteria:** [How will completion be measured]
    - **Resources Needed:** [Budget, people, tools, approvals required]
    - **Blocking Dependencies:** [What must happen first]
    - **Status Check Method:** [How progress will be reported]

    ## Commitment Categories

    **Immediate Actions (Next 7 Days):**
    [List urgent items with owners and deadlines]

    **Short-term Deliverables (1-4 Weeks):**
    [List project milestones and interim deadlines]

    **Long-term Initiatives (1+ Months):**
    [List strategic projects and major deliverables]

    ## Cross-Dependencies Map
    Identify where one action item depends on completion of others:
    - [Action A] must complete before [Action B] can begin
    - [Person X] needs deliverable from [Person Y] by [date]

    ## Follow-Up Schedule
    Recommend check-in meetings or status updates based on the timeline:
    - **Weekly check-ins needed for:** [high-risk or urgent items]
    - **Bi-weekly reviews for:** [standard project work]
    - **Monthly reviews for:** [long-term strategic initiatives]

    ## Potential Issues Flagged
    Based on discussion tone and content, identify:
    - Unclear ownership or scope
    - Unrealistic deadlines mentioned
    - Resource conflicts or constraints noted
    - Previous missed commitments referenced

  input_sample: |
    [Meeting starts]
    Project Manager: Let's review the Q4 deliverables. Sarah, can you handle the user research by month-end?

    Sarah (Marketing): Yes, I can design the survey by November 20th, but I'll need legal approval for the questions first.

    Legal (Mike): I can review by November 15th if you get me the draft by Wednesday.

    Project Manager: Great. Tom, what about the technical implementation?

    Tom (Engineering): I'll need the research results before I can start. Probably looking at December 15th for completion.
