  input_sample: |
    [Meeting starts]
    CEO: Alright, let's discuss the Q4 budget situation. Sarah, what's the engineering team's position on the product launch timeline?

    Sarah (Engineering Director): We're concerned about rushing the December 15th launch. We've identified three critical bugs that could impact user experience. I recommend pushing to January 31st to ensure quality.

    Marketing Director: That would affect our Q4 revenue projections significantly. Can we do a limited beta launch instead?

    CEO: Quality is paramount. I'm approving the delay and the $200K budget reallocation from marketing to engineering that Sarah requested last week.
