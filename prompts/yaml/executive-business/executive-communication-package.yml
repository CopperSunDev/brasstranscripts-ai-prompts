    [Leadership Team Meeting]
    CEO: We need to address the customer retention drop to 85%. I'm thinking about a loyalty program.

    CFO: Budget-wise, we have $200K in retention funds. ROI could be significant if we see the 15% CLV increase we're projecting.

    VP Engineering: We'd need 2 engineers for Q1. The CRM integration is doable but needs planning.

    CMO: This aligns with our customer-first messaging. We can reallocate some paid ad budget to this.

    Head of Sales: Enterprise customers have specifically asked about loyalty benefits. This could be a differentiator.

    CEO: Let's move forward. Sarah, can you scope the technical requirements? Mike, work with sales on feature priorities.
