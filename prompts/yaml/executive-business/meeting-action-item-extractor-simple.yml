  user_template: |
    Analyze the following meeting transcript and extract all action items, decisions, and follow-ups.

    For each action item, provide:
    1. **Task**: Clear description of what needs to be done
    2. **Owner**: Person responsible (from speaker labels, or "Unassigned" if unclear)
    3. **Deadline**: Due date if mentioned, or "Not specified"
    4. **Context**: Brief note on why this was assigned (1 sentence)

    Format the output as a structured list organized by owner. At the end, include:
    - **Key Decisions Made**: List any decisions finalized during the meeting
    - **Open Questions**: Items that need follow-up but weren't resolved
    - **Next Meeting Topics**: Items explicitly deferred to future discussion
