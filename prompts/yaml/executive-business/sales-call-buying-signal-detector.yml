  Review this sales call transcript and identify all buying signals—verbal cues indicating the prospect is moving toward a purchase decision.

  ## STRONG BUYING SIGNALS
  Statements indicating high purchase intent:
  - Asking about implementation/onboarding
  - Discussing specific use cases for their team
  - Inquiring about pricing, contracts, or terms
  - Mentioning timeline urgency
  - Asking "what's next?"

  Quote each signal and rate its strength.

  ## MODERATE BUYING SIGNALS
  Statements indicating growing interest:
  - Asking detailed technical questions
  - Sharing internal challenges the solution addresses
  - Requesting references or case studies
  - Involving additional stakeholders

  ## MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
  Moments where buying signals appeared but the rep didn't capitalize:
  - Signal that was ignored
  - What the rep said instead
  - Better response that would have advanced the deal

  ## BUYING SIGNAL TIMELINE
  Map when signals appeared during the call. Early signals indicate strong fit; late signals may indicate the rep successfully built value.

  ## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
  Based on the buying signals detected:
  - Is this prospect ready for a proposal?
  - What additional information would accelerate the decision?
  - Who else needs to be involved?
