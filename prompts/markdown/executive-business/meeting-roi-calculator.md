- AI processing time: [1-3 minutes per hour of meetings]
- Review and editing time: [5-10 minutes per meeting]
- Distribution time: [1-2 minutes per meeting]
- Total new documentation time: [Sum of above]

**Productivity Recovery:**
- Current documentation time: [From current state analysis]
- New documentation time: [From AI transcription analysis]
- Weekly time savings: [Current time - new time]
- Annual hours recovered: [Weekly savings × 52]
- Annual labor value recovered: [Annual hours × hourly rate]

**ROI CALCULATION**

**First Year Analysis:**
- Total implementation cost: [From implementation costs section]
- Total value delivered: [Annual labor value recovered]
- Net first-year benefit: [Value - cost]
- First-year ROI: [(Net benefit ÷ total cost) × 100]%

**Three-Year Projection:**
Year 1: [First-year net benefit]
Year 2: [Annual value - ongoing costs]
Year 3: [Annual value - ongoing costs]
- Total three-year value: [Sum of three years]
- Total three-year investment: [First year cost + 2 × ongoing annual costs]
- Three-year ROI: [(Total value - total investment) ÷ total investment × 100]%

**ADDITIONAL BENEFITS QUANTIFICATION**

**Soft Benefits Estimation:**
Estimate annual value of:
- Faster decision implementation: $[Reduced project delays]
- Improved client satisfaction: $[Estimated revenue impact]
- Reduced meeting rework: $[Time savings from fewer clarification meetings]
- Enhanced employee satisfaction: $[Reduced turnover costs]

**DECISION FRAMEWORK**

**Payback Period:**
- Monthly implementation cost: [First-year cost ÷ 12]
- Monthly value delivered: [Annual value ÷ 12]
- Payback period: [Implementation cost ÷ monthly net value] months

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Minimum utilization for positive ROI: [Monthly cost ÷ hourly savings rate] hours per month
- Current meeting volume: [Actual monthly hours]
- Utilization ratio: [Current volume ÷ minimum utilization]

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Based on your calculations:
- Implementation recommendation: [Proceed/Delay/Pilot]
- Optimal rollout strategy: [Gradual/Department-by-department/Organization-wide]
