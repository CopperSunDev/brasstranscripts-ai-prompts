   - Were job-related questions asked consistently?

   - Competencies that weren't adequately assessed
   - Missing follow-up questions that would strengthen evaluation

   - Confirmation bias patterns (seeking information that confirms initial impression)
   - Attribution errors (assumptions based on external traits)

5. **Recommendations**
   - Documentation improvements needed
   - Additional evaluation steps required
   - Training opportunities for interviewers
