## Best Practices

**Executive focus:** Emphasize strategic implications, resource needs, and decisions requiring executive awareness—filter out tactical details.

**Action-oriented:** Highlight decisions and action items that require executive approval, awareness, or follow-up rather than FYI information.

**Context inclusion:** Provide enough background that executives unfamiliar with details can understand significance and make informed decisions.

**Brevity priority:** Respect executive time by keeping summaries under 300 words while capturing all critical information.

## Use Cases

- **Executive awareness** - Keep leadership informed of department/team decisions
- **Decision escalation** - Surface decisions requiring executive approval
- **Strategic alignment** - Ensure leadership visibility into operational discussions
- **Board reporting** - Summarize management meetings for board review

## Example Output

### Executive Summary

**Meeting**: Q4 Product Planning Session
**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Attendees**: Product, Engineering, Sales Leadership
**Audience**: CEO & Board of Directors

---

### Meeting Purpose

Product and engineering leadership convened to finalize Q4 product roadmap priorities and evaluate enterprise feature set expansion required to support sales pipeline of 8 Fortune 500 prospects (combined potential ACV: $2.4M).

---

### Critical Decisions

**1. Accelerated Enterprise Feature Development**
Approved acceleration of enterprise feature roadmap (originally Q2 2026) to Q4 2025 to capture competitive opportunity. Decision driven by sales intel showing 6 of 8 prospects evaluating alternatives and will decide by December 31.

**2. Engineering Team Expansion Required**
Engineering leadership requested immediate hiring approval for 5 additional senior engineers and 2 engineering managers to support accelerated timeline. Estimated cost: $1.3M annualized (Q1 2026 budget impact).

**3. Enterprise Pricing Tier Strategy**
Sales proposed new enterprise pricing tier at $50K-150K ACV range (vs. current $5K-25K). Product and finance to develop detailed proposal including margin analysis and resource requirements.

---

### Resource Implications

**Budget Impact**:
- Engineering hiring: $1.3M annualized ($325K Q1 impact)
- Infrastructure costs: $150K additional annual cloud spend
- Total investment: $1.45M to capture $2.4M pipeline

**Timeline Risk**:
Engineering estimates 60% confidence in Q4 delivery. Alternative scenarios prepared if technical feasibility review reveals blockers.

---

### Strategic Insights

**Market Opportunity**: Sales pipeline demonstrates clear enterprise demand, but current product positioning is SMB-focused. Competitive analysis shows enterprise segment growing 40% YoY vs. 15% SMB growth.

**Competitive Pressure**: Two competitors (Salesforce, HubSpot) launching similar enterprise features Q1 2026. First-mover advantage exists but closing quickly.

**Organizational Readiness Concern**: VP Sales raised concern about customer success capacity to support enterprise clients. Current team designed for SMB customer base. May need enterprise CS hiring alongside engineering expansion.

---

### Action Items Requiring Executive Attention

**1. Hiring Approval Needed** (High Priority)
Engineering team expansion of 8 FTEs requires CEO approval for unbudgeted 2025 hiring. Finance can accommodate in Q1 2026 budget if approved. **Decision needed by: November 1, 2025**

**2. Customer Success Strategy Review** (Medium Priority)
Recommendation: CEO to commission customer success readiness assessment for enterprise expansion. May require additional hires beyond engineering. **Owner: VP Sales to present proposal**

**3. Board Awareness** (Upcoming)
Plan to present enterprise expansion strategy at January board meeting, including updated financials, hiring progress, and Q4 development status. **Owner: CEO**

---

**Immediate** (This Week):
- Approve engineering hiring expansion to begin recruiting immediately
- Request customer success readiness assessment from VP Sales

**Short-term** (Next 30 Days):
