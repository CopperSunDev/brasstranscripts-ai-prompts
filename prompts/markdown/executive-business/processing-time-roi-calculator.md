## The Prompt

```text
Calculate the productivity and cost impact of transcription processing speed on your specific workflow:

**CURRENT WORKFLOW ANALYSIS**

**Meeting/Recording Details:**
- Average meeting length: [X minutes]
- Meetings per week requiring transcription: [X]
- Current transcription method: [Manual notes/Service/None]
- Current processing time: [X hours/days]
- Current cost per transcript: $[X]

**PRODUCTIVITY CALCULATION**

**Time Analysis:**
Calculate current workflow delays:
- Hours waiting for transcription: [Current processing time × meetings per week]
- Delayed decisions due to unavailable documentation: [Estimate hours]
- Follow-up meetings needed for clarification: [Number × meeting length]
- Content publication delays: [Hours between recording and publication]

**Cost Analysis:**
Calculate current total cost:
- Direct transcription costs: $[Cost per transcript × weekly meetings]
- Opportunity cost of delays: $[Hourly rate × hours delayed]
- Rush processing fees: $[Additional fees when needed]
- Staff time on manual documentation: $[Hours × hourly rate]

**AI TRANSCRIPTION IMPACT PROJECTION**

**Speed Improvement:**
With 1-3 minute processing:
- New processing time per transcript: 3 minutes maximum
- Workflow acceleration: [Current time - 3 minutes]
- Same-day turnaround capability: [Yes/No for all meetings]
- Reduced follow-up meeting need: [Estimated reduction %]

**Cost Improvement:**
Calculate new costs:
- AI transcription cost: $[2.50 for 1-15 min, $6.00 for 16-120 min per file]
- Eliminated opportunity costs: $[Saved hours × hourly rate]
- Reduced rush processing needs: $[Monthly savings]
- Staff productivity improvement: $[Hours saved × hourly rate]

**ROI CALCULATION**

**Monthly Savings:**
- Direct cost reduction: $[Old cost - new cost]
- Productivity time savings: $[Hours saved × hourly rate]
- Faster implementation benefits: $[Estimated value of quicker decisions]
- **Total monthly value**: $[Sum of all savings]

**Annual ROI:**
- **Investment**: AI transcription annual cost
- **Savings**: Monthly savings × 12
- **ROI Percentage**: [(Annual savings - annual cost) ÷ annual cost] × 100
- **Payback Period**: [Annual cost ÷ monthly savings] months

**WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

Based on your calculation:
- Immediate workflow changes to implement
- Training needed for team adoption
- Integration requirements with current tools
- Measurement metrics to track success

Include specific examples of how faster processing will improve your team's specific use cases and decision-making speed.
