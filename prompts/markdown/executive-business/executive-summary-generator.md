## Best Practices

**Customize for your organization:** Modify the format to match your company's reporting standards and executive preferences.

**Use speaker identification:** If you have JSON format with speaker labels, reference specific executives by name to add accountability and context.

**Include confidence indicators:** When the AI identifies unclear decisions or incomplete action items, flag them for clarification.

**Link to strategy:** Always connect meeting outcomes to broader business objectives executives care about.

## Use Cases

- **Board meeting preparation** - Distill department updates into strategic highlights
- **Cross-functional alignment** - Extract commitments and dependencies between teams
- **Investor update compilation** - Gather key metrics and decisions across multiple meetings
- **Crisis response documentation** - Capture critical decisions during emergency sessions
