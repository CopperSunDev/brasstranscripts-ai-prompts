- **Expert witness coordination** - Brief experts on factual inconsistencies supporting their opinions

## Example Output

### Internal Consistency Analysis

**Contradiction #1:**
- **Page/Line References:** Page 47/Lines 12-15 vs. Page 112/Lines 3-8
- **Statement A:** "I never discussed the contract terms with Mr. Johnson before signing" (Page 47/Lines 12-15)
- **Statement B:** "Mr. Johnson and I went over several concerns about the payment schedule during our lunch meeting" (Page 112/Lines 3-8)
- **Nature of Conflict:** Direct contradiction about whether contract discussions occurred
- **Potential Significance:** Undermines witness credibility and supports opposing party's claim of informed consent
- **Follow-up Questions Suggested:** "When did this lunch meeting occur?" "What specific concerns were discussed?" "Why didn't you mention this discussion earlier?"

**Timeline Inconsistency:**
- **Event:** Contract signing meeting
- **Conflicting Timeframes:** "Early morning, around 9 AM" (Page 23) vs. "After lunch, probably 2 PM" (Page 89)
- **References:** Page 23/Line 7 and Page 89/Lines 14-16
- **Clarification Needed:** Exact time of meeting to verify attendance of other parties

### Credibility Assessment Factors

**Memory-Related Issues:**
- Witness claims "I don't remember" 23 times regarding events unfavorable to their position
- Provides detailed recollection of conversations that support their case (down to specific phrases)
- Cannot recall receiving important documents but remembers precise wording of oral agreements

**Bias Indicators:**
- Consistently describes opposing party using negative language ("aggressive," "unreasonable")
- Defensive tone increases when questioned about financial motivations
- Minimizes their own role in disputed events while emphasizing others' responsibilities

### Strategic Analysis

**Priority #1: Contract Discussion Contradiction**
- **Impact:** Destroys witness's credibility on central issue of informed consent
- **Proof Required:** Phone records, calendar entries, or restaurant receipts proving lunch meeting
- **Cross-Examination Approach:** Present timeline, establish lunch meeting, then present contradiction without explanation opportunity

**Areas Requiring Additional Investigation:**
- **Investigative Need:** Verify lunch meeting between witness and Mr. Johnson
- **Potential Sources:** Restaurant receipts, credit card records, calendar entries, phone records
- **Timeline for Discovery:** Must complete before witness's next deposition in 30 days
