## Example Output

### Witness Assessment Profile

**Credibility Strengths:**
- Witness appears confident and knowledgeable about technical contract details
- Provides specific dates and times for most events
- Admits uncertainty when genuinely unsure rather than guessing

**Credibility Weaknesses:**
- Memory becomes vague when discussing events unfavorable to their position
- Defensive and evasive when questioned about financial motivations
- Multiple contradictions between current testimony and prior statements

**Defensive Triggers:**
- Questions about personal financial gain from the transaction
- Suggestions of improper conduct or ethical violations
- Challenges to their professional competence or expertise

### Strategic Cross-Examination Topic #1: Contract Terms Discussion

**Objective:** Establish that witness had detailed knowledge of contract terms despite claiming ignorance

**Question Sequence:**

1. **Foundation Questions:**
   - "You testified that you have 15 years of experience in contract negotiations, correct?" (Page 12/Lines 4-6)
   - "And you've personally reviewed hundreds of contracts in your career?" (Page 13/Lines 8-10)

2. **Commitment Questions:**
   - "You told us earlier that you never discussed the payment terms with anyone before signing, is that right?" (Page 47/Lines 12-15)
   - "You're certain there were no conversations about payment schedules?" (Page 48/Lines 2-4)

3. **Contradiction/Challenge Questions:**
   - "But you also testified that you and Mr. Johnson discussed 'several concerns about the payment schedule during your lunch meeting,' didn't you?" (Page 112/Lines 3-8)
   - Evidence to Present: Timeline exhibit showing lunch meeting occurred before contract signing

4. **Impact Questions:**
   - "So your testimony about never discussing payment terms was incorrect, wasn't it?"
   - "This was an important detail you failed to mention initially, correct?"

**Potential Responses and Counters:**
- **If witness says:** "I forgot about that conversation"
- **Follow-up strategy:** "These payment terms were worth $200,000 to your company - are you saying you forgot about a $200,000 discussion?"
- **Backup evidence:** Calendar entries, restaurant receipts proving lunch meeting occurred

### Evidence Integration Strategy

**Documentary Evidence:** Contract with highlighted payment terms section
- **Purpose:** Show witness had to have understood payment implications
- **Introduction Method:** Have witness read relevant sections aloud
- **Anticipated Response:** Witness may claim they didn't understand implications

**Impeachment Evidence:** Prior deposition testimony about "never discussing terms"
- **Current Conflict:** Current admission of lunch meeting discussion
- **Presentation Strategy:** Read both statements verbatim, then ask which is true

### Courtroom Presentation Strategy

**Opening Cross-Examination:**
- **First topic:** Contract expertise and experience (establishes witness should know better)
- **Tone setting:** Professional but firm, establishing control
- **Jury connection:** Focus on credibility - "Can we trust what this witness tells us?"

**Closing Cross-Examination:**
- **Final topic:** Financial motivation for testifying
- **Summary approach:** "Multiple contradictions raise serious questions about reliability"
- **Transition:** Sets up impeachment theme for remaining witnesses
