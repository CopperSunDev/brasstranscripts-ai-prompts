## Overview

This prompt analyzes project requirements to recommend whether AI transcription (professional-grade accuracy, fast, affordable) or human transcription (99% accuracy, slow, expensive) is the better choice. It provides honest trade-off analysis, cost comparisons, and hybrid strategies when appropriate.

## When to Use This Prompt

- **Service Method Selection**: Choosing between AI and human transcription
- **Quality vs Cost Trade-offs**: Understanding if premium pricing is justified
- **Compliance Requirements**: Determining if legal/medical standards require human transcription
- **Project Planning**: Estimating costs and timelines for transcription projects
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating accuracy risks for specific use cases

## The Prompt

```
I need help deciding whether to use AI transcription (BrassTranscripts) or human transcription (Rev) for my project.

Project details:
- **Content type**: [Specify what you're transcribing, e.g., "podcast interviews" or "legal depositions" or "research interviews" or "business meetings"]
- **Audio quality**: [Specify typical quality, e.g., "clear studio recording" or "phone call with background noise" or "conference room with multiple speakers"]
- **Speaker characteristics**: [Specify, e.g., "native English speakers, clear diction" or "heavy accents" or "technical jargon" or "medical terminology"]
- **Volume**: [Specify amount, e.g., "5 hours total" or "20 hours monthly ongoing"]
- **Accuracy requirements**: [Specify needs, e.g., "rough draft for editing" or "court-admissible transcript" or "publication-ready quotes"]
- **Timeline**: [Specify urgency, e.g., "same-day turnaround needed" or "1-week deadline acceptable"]
- **Use case**: [Specify purpose, e.g., "blog post source material" or "legal evidence" or "medical records" or "content creation"]
- **Budget**: [Specify constraints, e.g., "$200 total budget" or "unlimited for compliance" or "tight academic budget"]

Please analyze my project and provide:

1. **Primary recommendation** (AI, human, or hybrid approach) with specific reasoning
2. **Cost comparison** showing total project cost for AI vs. human options
3. **Accuracy expectations** for my specific audio type and quality
4. **Risk assessment** if choosing the more affordable option (what could go wrong?)
5. **Hybrid strategy** if applicable (e.g., AI for some parts, human for others)
6. **Quality assurance approach** to maximize accuracy regardless of choice
7. **Deal-breakers** - specific scenarios where I should absolutely choose one over the other

Be honest about trade-offs. If human transcription is genuinely necessary for my use case, explain why the 10× cost is justified. If AI is sufficient, explain what quality checks I should implement.

## Example Use Cases

### Podcast Content Creator

**Input**:
- Content type: Weekly podcast interviews
- Audio quality: Clear studio recording, two speakers
- Speaker characteristics: Native English speakers, clear diction
- Volume: 8 hours monthly ongoing
- Accuracy requirements: Good enough for show notes and blog posts
- Timeline: Same-day preferred for rapid publishing
- Use case: Content creation (not legal/medical)
- Budget: $100/month maximum

**Expected Output**:
- **Recommendation**: AI transcription (BrassTranscripts)
- **Cost**: $72/month (AI) vs $720/month (human)
- **Accuracy**: 96-97% sufficient for editorial use
- **Risk**: Minimal - content undergoes editing anyway
- **Quality assurance**: Spot-check quotes before publishing
- **Reasoning**: 10× cost premium not justified for content that's edited

### Legal Deposition

**Input**:
- Content type: Legal deposition for court case
- Audio quality: Conference room recording, some overlap
- Speaker characteristics: Legal terminology, some technical language
- Volume: 3 hours one-time
- Accuracy requirements: Court-admissible, certified transcript
- Timeline: 1-week acceptable
- Use case: Legal evidence for trial
- Budget: Unlimited for compliance

**Expected Output**:
- **Recommendation**: Human transcription (Rev)
- **Cost**: $270 (human, certified) vs $27 (AI, not admissible)
- **Accuracy**: 99% required for court admissibility
- **Risk**: AI transcript may not be legally acceptable
- **Deal-breaker**: Court requirements mandate human transcription
- **Reasoning**: $243 premium prevents thousands in attorney time if transcript rejected

### Academic Research Interviews

**Input**:
- Content type: Qualitative research interviews
- Audio quality: Interview recordings, mostly clear
- Speaker characteristics: Some participants with accents
- Volume: 20 hours total for dissertation
- Accuracy requirements: 95%+ for thematic analysis
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks acceptable
- Use case: Research analysis, will verify critical quotes
- Budget: $300 total project budget

**Expected Output**:
- **Recommendation**: Hybrid approach
- **Cost**: $180 (all AI) vs $1,800 (all human) vs $450 (hybrid)
- **Hybrid strategy**: AI for all 20 hours ($180), human re-transcription for heavily accented interviews only (~3 hours, $270)
- **Quality assurance**: Researcher verifies all quotes before publication
- **Reasoning**: Research budget allows hybrid, ensuring quality on difficult audio while saving on clear recordings

### Medical Consultation Records

**Input**:
- Content type: Patient consultation recordings
- Audio quality: Clinical setting, some background noise
- Speaker characteristics: Medical terminology, some patient accents
- Volume: 10 hours monthly
- Accuracy requirements: 99%+ for medical records compliance
- Timeline: 48 hours acceptable
- Use case: Official medical records
- Budget: Compliance-driven, flexible

**Expected Output**:
- **Recommendation**: Human transcription (Rev HIPAA)
- **Cost**: $900/month (human) vs $90/month (AI)
- **Accuracy**: 99%+ required for patient safety and liability
- **Risk**: Medical errors from transcription mistakes create liability exceeding cost savings
- **Deal-breaker**: HIPAA compliance and patient safety mandate human transcription
- **Reasoning**: $810/month premium is negligible compared to malpractice liability risk

## Expected AI Response Structure

1. **Clear Recommendation**: AI, human, or hybrid with confident reasoning
2. **Cost Breakdown**: Total project cost for each option
3. **Accuracy Analysis**: Expected accuracy for the specific audio/content type
4. **Risk Assessment**: Honest evaluation of what could go wrong with cheaper option
5. **Hybrid Strategy**: When and how to combine approaches strategically
6. **Quality Checks**: Specific steps to validate accuracy
7. **Deal-Breakers**: Scenarios where one option is absolutely required

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Specify Use Case Clearly**: "Legal deposition" vs "podcast" changes everything
2. **Describe Audio Quality Honestly**: "Clear" vs "noisy" affects recommendation
3. **State Compliance Needs**: Legal/medical requirements override cost considerations
4. **Include Budget Reality**: "Tight budget" vs "unlimited" enables different recommendations
5. **Mention Review Process**: If you're editing anyway, accuracy tolerance is higher
