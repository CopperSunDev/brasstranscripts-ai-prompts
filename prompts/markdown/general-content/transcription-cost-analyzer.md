## Overview

This prompt helps users choose the most cost-effective transcription service by analyzing their specific usage patterns, budget constraints, and quality requirements. Instead of defaulting to the cheapest per-minute rate, it calculates total cost based on actual usage scenarios and identifies hidden costs.

## When to Use This Prompt

- **Service Selection**: Choosing between multiple transcription services
- **Budget Planning**: Estimating monthly transcription costs for projects
- **Cost Optimization**: Finding savings in existing transcription workflows
- **Subscription vs Pay-Per-Use**: Deciding which pricing model fits your needs
- **Volume Analysis**: Understanding if bulk discounts or enterprise pricing make sense

## The Prompt

```
I need help choosing the most cost-effective transcription service for my needs.

My transcription requirements:
- **Monthly volume**: [Specify hours per month, e.g., "5-8 hours monthly" or "varies between 2-20 hours"]
- **Usage pattern**: [Specify consistency, e.g., "consistent every month" or "sporadic - heavy some months, light others"]
- **Audio quality**: [Specify typical quality, e.g., "clear studio recordings" or "conference calls with background noise"]
- **Accuracy requirements**: [Specify needs, e.g., "95%+ for blog content" or "99%+ for legal depositions"]
- **Turnaround needs**: [Specify timing, e.g., "same-day preferred" or "24-48 hours acceptable"]
- **Budget constraints**: [Specify limits, e.g., "$50/month maximum" or "willing to pay premium for quality"]
- **Additional features**: [Specify needs, e.g., "need SRT captions" or "multi-language support" or "speaker identification"]

Please analyze my requirements and recommend:

1. **Primary service recommendation** with specific reasoning based on my usage pattern
2. **Cost calculation** showing expected monthly costs based on my volume
3. **Alternative options** if my usage patterns change (lighter or heavier months)
4. **Cost-saving strategies** specific to my needs (batching, format optimization, volume discounts)
5. **Hidden costs to watch for** based on the services you recommend
6. **Hybrid approach** if combining multiple services would save money

Compare at least 3 services and show the math on why your recommendation is most cost-effective for my specific situation, not just the lowest per-minute rate.
```

## Example Use Cases

### Content Creator with Variable Volume

**Input**:
- Monthly volume: Varies between 8-15 hours
- Usage pattern: Inconsistent - heavy during production months
- Audio quality: Clear studio recordings
- Accuracy requirements: 95%+ for show notes and blog posts
- Turnaround needs: Same-day preferred
- Budget constraints: $150/month maximum
- Additional features: Need SRT captions for YouTube

**Expected Output**:
- Recommendation for pay-per-use service vs subscription
- Cost comparison across Otter, BrassTranscripts, Temi
- Analysis of whether subscription waste exceeds per-minute cost premium
- Batching strategies for short episode segments
- Caption format cost analysis

### Academic Researcher with Sporadic Needs

**Input**:
- Monthly volume: 20 hours during data collection (2-3 months), then nothing
- Usage pattern: Highly sporadic project-based
- Audio quality: Interview recordings, mostly clear
- Accuracy requirements: 95%+ for analysis, verify quotes manually
- Turnaround needs: 1-week acceptable
- Budget constraints: $300 total project budget
- Additional features: None required

**Expected Output**:
- Recommendation against subscriptions (waste during dormant months)
- Per-project cost analysis
- Student/academic discount opportunities
- Free tier strategic usage for drafts
- Human transcription for unclear audio sections only

### Business with Consistent High Volume

**Input**:
- Monthly volume: 40-50 hours consistently
- Usage pattern: Consistent every month (client meetings, consultations)
- Audio quality: Conference calls with some background noise
- Accuracy requirements: 95%+ for internal documentation
- Turnaround needs: 24-48 hours acceptable
- Budget constraints: $500/month maximum
- Additional features: Speaker identification required

**Expected Output**:
- Enterprise pricing negotiation opportunities
- Volume discount analysis
- Cost comparison of AI vs human at scale
- API integration cost/benefit (AWS Transcribe, Google Cloud Speech)
- Hybrid approach (AI for internal, human for critical client deliverables)

## Expected AI Response Structure

1. **Primary Recommendation**: Specific service with reasoning tied to usage pattern
2. **Cost Breakdown**: Monthly cost calculation with real numbers
3. **Alternative Scenarios**: "If your volume drops to X hours" or "If volume increases to Y hours"
4. **Cost-Saving Strategies**: Actionable steps specific to the user's workflow
5. **Hidden Costs**: Format fees, per-user charges, storage fees, overage rates
6. **Hybrid Approach**: When and why to combine services

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific About Volume**: "5-8 hours" is better than "a few hours"
2. **Describe Consistency**: Specify if usage is regular or bursty
3. **Mention Format Needs**: Caption files often have hidden costs
4. **State Real Budget**: AI can work within constraints if you're honest
5. **Include Quality Tolerance**: "Good enough for drafts" vs "publication-ready"

## What Makes This Prompt Effective

- **Structured Input**: Clear fields prevent vague analysis
- **Total Cost Focus**: Emphasizes real cost vs advertised rates
- **Math Requirement**: Forces specific calculations, not generic advice
- **Hidden Cost Awareness**: Surfaces fees that pricing tables hide
- **Scenario Planning**: Considers usage variation, not just current state
