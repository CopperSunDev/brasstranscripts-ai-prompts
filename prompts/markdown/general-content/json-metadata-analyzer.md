**Category**: General Content
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Estimated Tokens**: 900-1300
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Description

Extract comprehensive insights from JSON transcript metadata including speaker analytics, confidence scores, and timing patterns. Perfect for quality assurance, content analysis, and understanding conversation dynamics through structured data analysis.

## The Prompt

```text
Analyze this JSON transcript and provide detailed insights about the conversation.

Analysis Requirements:

## Speaker Analytics
- Total number of speakers
- Speaking time per speaker (duration and percentage)
- Turn-taking patterns and interruptions
- Speech pace (words per minute per speaker)

## Quality Metrics
- Average confidence score by speaker
- Low-confidence sections (score < 0.85) requiring review
- Word count and vocabulary complexity
- Speech clarity indicators

## Content Insights
- Main topics discussed (extracted from high-confidence segments)
- Key moments (based on speaker transitions and timing)
- Engagement patterns (question-response dynamics)
- Summary of discussion flow

## Technical Details
- Total duration
- Language detected
- Words per segment statistics
- Timestamp accuracy verification

Please format the analysis as a comprehensive report with:
1. Executive summary
2. Detailed speaker breakdown
3. Quality assessment
4. Content highlights
5. Actionable recommendations

## Best Practices

**Confidence Threshold:** Flag segments with scores below 0.85 for manual review to ensure accuracy.

**Speaker Identification:** Use speaker labels to track participation balance and identify dominant voices.

**Timing Analysis:** Leverage word-level timestamps to identify pacing issues or rapid speech sections.

**Quality Assurance:** Use confidence scores to prioritize sections needing human verification.

## Use Cases

- **Meeting Analysis** - Identify who spoke most, key decisions, and participation balance
- **Quality Assurance** - Find low-confidence sections requiring manual review and correction
- **Content Research** - Extract themes, topics, and key insights from interviews
- **Performance Metrics** - Measure speech clarity, pacing, and engagement patterns
- **Transcription Validation** - Verify accuracy through confidence score analysis
- **Speaker Behavior** - Analyze turn-taking patterns, interruptions, and conversation flow

## Analysis Output Example
