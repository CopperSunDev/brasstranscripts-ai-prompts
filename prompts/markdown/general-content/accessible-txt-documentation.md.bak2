## Best Practices

**Speaker Identification:** Use consistent "Speaker Name:" format at the start of each turn for clear attribution.

**Paragraph Structure:** Group related exchanges logically to improve reading flow and comprehension.

**Filler Word Removal:** Edit out "um," "uh," "like" to create cleaner, more professional documentation.
