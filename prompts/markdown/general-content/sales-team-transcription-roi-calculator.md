## The Prompt

```text
Calculate whether DIY transcription can replace our conversation intelligence platform.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Number of sales reps: [NUMBER]
- Current platform: [GONG/CHORUS/REVENUE.IO/OTHER/NONE]
- Current monthly cost: $[AMOUNT] or [UNKNOWN]
- Calls recorded per rep per month: [NUMBER]
- Average call length: [MINUTES]

WHAT WE USE THE PLATFORM FOR:
- [ ] Call recording
- [ ] Automatic transcription
- [ ] AI-generated call summaries
- [ ] Objection tracking
- [ ] Competitor mention alerts
- [ ] Coaching scorecards
- [ ] CRM integration
- [ ] Deal risk scoring
- [ ] Pipeline analytics

CALCULATE DIY ALTERNATIVE:

1. **Transcription costs** (BrassTranscripts)
   - Per-file flat pricing — bulk batches typically apply for sales teams (Tiered $3.00–$6.00/file across 7 batch sizes; 100+ monthly calls hit the $3.50/file tier, 250+ hit $3.00/file)
   - Calculate: [reps] × [calls/rep] × applicable bulk tier price (use brasstranscripts.com/bulk-transcription-guide for current tiers)
   - Monthly and annual projection

2. **AI analysis costs** (ChatGPT/Claude)
   - Estimate prompt usage for call analysis
   - $20/user/month for ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro
   - Or API costs at ~$0.01-0.03 per call analysis

3. **Total DIY cost**
   - Transcription + AI tools
   - Compare to current platform cost

4. **Feature gap analysis**
   - What we lose without enterprise platform
   - What we keep with DIY approach
   - What we might gain (flexibility, no lock-in)

PROVIDE:
- Monthly savings (or additional cost) of DIY approach
- Annual savings projection
- Break-even team size (where enterprise makes sense)
- Recommendation based on our checked features
- Implementation effort estimate (hours to set up DIY workflow)

## Best Practices

**Be honest about feature usage:** Most teams use only 20-30% of enterprise platform capabilities.

**Include implementation time:** DIY requires workflow setup—factor this into cost comparison.

**Consider scale:** Break-even points shift significantly with team size.

**Evaluate lock-in:** Enterprise platforms often require annual commitments.

## Use Cases

- **Cost reduction initiatives** - Evaluate alternatives to expensive SaaS
- **Small team optimization** - Right-size tools for 5-15 person sales teams
- **Startup budgeting** - Build sales infrastructure without enterprise pricing
- **Platform migration** - Compare before switching conversation intelligence providers

## Example Output

**Input**: 10 reps, currently on Gong ($100/user/month), 50 calls/rep/month, 25 min average

**Current Cost (Gong)**
- Monthly: 10 × $100 = $1,000
- Annual: $12,000

**DIY Alternative**
- Transcription: 10 × 50 × $6 = $3,000/month (high volume)
- AI analysis: 10 × $20 = $200/month
- Total: $3,200/month

**Feature Gap Analysis**
- ✅ Keep: Recording, transcription, AI summaries, objection tracking
- ❌ Lose: CRM auto-sync, real-time coaching, pipeline analytics
- ➕ Gain: No annual lock-in, prompt customization, lower per-call cost at lower volumes

**Recommendation**: At 50 calls/rep/month, DIY costs MORE than Gong. However, at 20 calls/rep/month, DIY costs $1,400/month vs Gong's $1,000—closer. If you don't use CRM integration or pipeline analytics, consider DIY.
