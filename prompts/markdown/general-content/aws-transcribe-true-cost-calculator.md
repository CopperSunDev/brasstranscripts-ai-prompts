## Overview

This prompt helps you calculate the TRUE total cost of using AWS Transcribe by revealing all hidden fees that aren't included in the advertised $0.024/minute pricing. Most users are surprised to discover that AWS Transcribe costs significantly more than expected once you factor in speaker identification fees, S3 storage, data transfer charges, regional pricing variations, and 15-second minimum request penalties.

**Perfect for**:
- Users evaluating AWS Transcribe vs BrassTranscripts
- Calculating actual monthly transcription costs
- Discovering hidden AWS fees before they appear on your bill
- Determining break-even points for service switching
- Budget planning with realistic cost projections

## The Prompt

```
Calculate my TRUE AWS Transcribe costs including all hidden fees:

**My Usage:**
- Monthly audio volume: [X hours, e.g., "50 hours"]
- Audio format: [MP3/WAV/other]
- Need speaker identification: [Yes/No]
- Need custom vocabulary: [Yes/No]
- AWS region: [US East/Europe/Asia Pacific/other]
- Average file length: [X minutes]
- Number of files per month: [X files]
- Storage duration needed: [X months]

**Please Calculate:**

1. **Base AWS Transcribe cost** by tier (include tier breakdown)
2. **Speaker identification fees** (if applicable)
3. **S3 storage costs** ($0.023/GB/month)
4. **Data transfer costs** (if applicable)
5. **Regional pricing adjustment** (if outside US East)
6. **15-second minimum impact** (if many short files)
7. **Custom vocabulary fees** (if applicable)

**Then Compare:**
- **AWS Transcribe TOTAL** (all fees included)
- **BrassTranscripts cost** ($0.15/min all-inclusive, $2.25 for 0-15 min)

Show me:
- Which service is cheaper for MY specific usage
- Break-even point if volume changes
- Hidden costs I might not know about
- When BrassTranscripts' all-inclusive pricing becomes better value

Be specific with dollar amounts and show the math.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Podcast Transcription

**Input:**
```
Monthly audio volume: 10 hours
Audio format: MP3
Need speaker identification: Yes
AWS region: US East
Average file length: 60 minutes
Number of files per month: 10
Storage duration: 2 months
```

**Expected Output:**
```
AWS TRANSCRIBE TOTAL COST:
- Base transcription (600 min @ $0.024): $14.40
- Speaker identification (20-40% markup): +$3-6
- S3 storage (290 MB @ $0.023/GB × 2 months): $0.01
- 15-second minimum impact: $0 (files > 15 seconds)
TOTAL: $17.41 - $20.41/month

BRASSTRANSCRIPTS COST:
- 10 hours @ $0.15/min: $90.00/month
- Speaker ID: Included
- Storage: Included
TOTAL: $90.00/month

VERDICT: AWS is cheaper at this volume ($17-20 vs $90)
HOWEVER: AWS requires 4-6 hours setup time, S3 management, IAM configuration
BrassTranscripts offers: Zero setup, included speaker ID, simpler workflow
```

### Example 2: Research Interview Transcription (Short Clips)

**Input:**
```
Monthly audio volume: 5 hours (300 short clips of 1 minute each)
Audio format: MP3
Need speaker identification: Yes
AWS region: Europe (Frankfurt)
Average file length: 1 minute
Number of files per month: 300
Storage duration: 6 months
```

**Expected Output:**
```
AWS TRANSCRIBE TOTAL COST:
- Base transcription (300 min @ $0.026 EU pricing): $7.80
- Speaker identification (30% markup): +$2.34
- 15-second minimum penalty (300 clips × 15 sec minimum): $1.95 EXTRA
- S3 storage (145 MB × 6 months accumulation): $0.02
- Regional markup (Europe): Already included above
TOTAL: $12.11/month

BRASSTRANSCRIPTS COST:
- 5 hours @ $0.15/min after $2.25 minimum: $45.00/month
- Speaker ID: Included
- No per-request minimums
TOTAL: $45.00/month

VERDICT: AWS still cheaper ($12 vs $45)
BUT WATCH: 15-second minimum costs you $1.95 extra monthly
If file count increases, this penalty grows rapidly
```

## Tips for Best Results

✅ **Be specific about volume ranges**: "50-80 hours" is better than "moderate usage"
✅ **State audio format accurately**: WAV files cost 20× more to store than MP3
✅ **Mention speaker ID needs explicitly**: This is the biggest hidden cost
✅ **Include actual file counts**: Helps calculate 15-second minimum impact
✅ **Specify AWS region**: Can be 20-30% cost difference
✅ **State storage needs**: S3 costs accumulate over months
✅ **Mention growth plans**: Helps calculate future break-even points

❌ **Don't use vague estimates**: "Some audio" doesn't help cost calculation
❌ **Don't assume base pricing only**: Hidden fees often exceed base cost
❌ **Don't forget regional pricing**: Can add 30% to your bill
❌ **Don't ignore 15-second minimums**: Can triple costs for short clips
