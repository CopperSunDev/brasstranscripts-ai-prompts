## Overview

This prompt helps you calculate the TRUE total cost of using Sonix by revealing all hidden fees and pricing complexity beyond the advertised base rate. Calculate TRUE Sonix costs with hybrid subscription + usage model - confusing crossover point at 4.4 hours/month, per-seat monthly fees even in low-usage months, and translation pricing complexity.

**Perfect for**:
- Users evaluating Sonix vs BrassTranscripts
- Calculating actual monthly transcription costs
- Discovering hidden fees before they appear on your bill
- Determining break-even points for service switching
- Budget planning with realistic cost projections

## The Prompt

```
Calculate my TRUE Sonix costs including all hidden fees:

**My Usage:**
- Monthly audio volume: [X hours, e.g., "50 hours"]
- Need speaker identification: [Yes/No]
- Primary use case: [Podcasts/Meetings/Interviews/Other]
- Average file length: [X minutes]
- Number of files per month: [X files]

**Please Calculate:**

1. **Base Sonix cost** (include all tier/model options)
2. **Add-on feature costs** (speaker ID, sentiment, etc.)
3. **Infrastructure/setup costs** (if applicable)
4. **Hidden fees** (minimums, regional pricing, etc.)
5. **Total monthly cost** (all fees included)

**Then Compare:**
- **Sonix TOTAL** (all fees included)
- **BrassTranscripts cost** ($0.15/min all-inclusive, $2.25 for 0-15 min)

Show me:
- Which service is cheaper for MY specific usage
- Break-even point if volume changes
- Hidden costs I might not know about
- When BrassTranscripts' all-inclusive pricing becomes better value

Be specific with dollar amounts and show the math.

## Tips for Best Results

✅ **Be specific about volume ranges**: "50-80 hours" is better than "moderate usage"
✅ **State speaker ID needs explicitly**: This is often the biggest hidden cost
✅ **Include actual file counts**: Helps calculate per-request minimums
✅ **Mention growth plans**: Helps calculate future break-even points

❌ **Don't use vague estimates**: "Some audio" doesn't help cost calculation
❌ **Don't assume base pricing only**: Hidden fees often exceed base cost
