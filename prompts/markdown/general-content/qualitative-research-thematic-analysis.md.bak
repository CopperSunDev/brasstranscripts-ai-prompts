## Description

Conduct systematic thematic analysis of qualitative research interviews following structured coding phases. This prompt guides AI through formal thematic analysis methodology—initial coding, theme development, theme review, and analytical insights—providing researchers with preliminary analysis that follows qualitative research best practices. Perfect for grounded theory, phenomenology, or thematic analysis research projects.

## The Prompt

```text
Conduct a thematic analysis of this qualitative research interview following systematic coding principles.

Research Context:
- Study focus: [RESEARCH TOPIC]
- Research questions: [PRIMARY QUESTIONS]
- Participant: [DEMOGRAPHIC INFO - ANONYMIZED]
- Methodological approach: [GROUNDED THEORY / PHENOMENOLOGY / ETC]

Analysis Requirements:

## Phase 1: Initial Coding
- Read through the entire transcript
- Identify meaningful segments related to research questions
- Generate initial descriptive codes for significant statements
- Note any surprising or unexpected responses

## Phase 2: Theme Development
- Group related codes into potential themes
- Identify patterns and relationships between codes
- Develop theme names that capture essential meanings
- Provide representative quotes for each theme

## Phase 3: Theme Review
For each identified theme, provide:
1. Theme name and brief definition
2. 2-3 representative quotes with context
3. How this theme relates to research questions
4. Connections to other themes
5. Preliminary interpretation

## Phase 4: Analytical Insights
- Contradictions or tensions within the data
- Participant's unique perspective or experiences
- Concepts requiring further exploration in future interviews
- Methodological notes (unclear responses, topic saturation, etc.)

Formatting Requirements:
- Use participant's own language in theme names when possible
- Maintain confidentiality (use pseudonyms, remove identifying details)
- Include line numbers or timestamps for quote references
- Note emotional content or significant pauses if relevant to interpretation

## Use Cases

- **Dissertation research** - Systematic analysis of participant interviews for thesis/dissertation projects
- **Academic research projects** - Formal qualitative analysis following published methodologies
- **Grant-funded studies** - Rigorous thematic analysis meeting research standards
- **Mixed-methods research** - Qualitative component analysis in mixed-methods designs

## Best Practices

**Researcher primacy**: Use AI output as preliminary analysis only. Researcher must review, refine, and validate all codes and themes through iterative cycles.

**Methodological rigor**: AI analysis provides starting points but cannot replace the interpretive depth and contextual understanding that human researchers bring to qualitative analysis.

**Phase-by-phase refinement**: Review each phase independently rather than accepting full output wholesale. Verify codes before theme development.

**Transparency in reporting**: When using AI-assisted analysis, document this in methodology sections and explain human researcher's role in validation and interpretation.
