## Overview

This prompt helps you analyze which transcription service pricing model (pay-per-file vs subscription) fits your actual usage patterns and workflow needs. Instead of guessing which service to choose based on marketing materials, this prompt calculates real costs, identifies must-have features, and recommends the best option for YOUR specific situation.

**Perfect for**:
- Users choosing between BrassTranscripts and subscription services (Otter, Rev, Votars.ai, etc.)
- Calculating monthly costs for both pricing models
- Identifying required features vs. nice-to-have extras
- Determining when pay-per-use saves money vs. when subscriptions are better
- Making data-driven service selection decisions

## The Prompt

```
I need help choosing between transcription services based on my usage patterns. Please analyze which option (pay-per-file or subscription) would be more cost-effective and practical for my needs.

My Transcription Usage:
- Average minutes transcribed per month: [YOUR NUMBER]
- Typical file length: [e.g., 30 minutes, 90 minutes, 2 hours]
- Usage consistency: [e.g., "Every week", "2-3 times per month", "Varies significantly"]
- Content type: [e.g., Podcasts, Meetings, Interviews, Lectures, Mixed]
- Team size: [Solo / 2-5 people / 6+ people]

Required Features:
- [ ] Real-time live transcription
- [ ] Speaker identification
- [ ] Subtitle file formats (SRT/VTT)
- [ ] AI summarization
- [ ] Team collaboration
- [ ] Multi-language support (specify languages: [YOUR LANGUAGES])
- [ ] Integration with other tools (specify: [YOUR TOOLS])

Budget Information:
- Current monthly transcription spending: $[YOUR AMOUNT] or [FREE/TRIAL currently]
- Maximum monthly budget: $[YOUR MAXIMUM]
- Billing preference: [Monthly subscription / Pay-per-use / Either works]

Based on this information:

1. Calculate my monthly costs for both BrassTranscripts (pay-per-file at $2.25 for 1-15 min, $0.15/min for 16+ min) and typical subscription services (assume ~$20-50/month for mid-tier)

2. Identify which features I actually need vs. nice-to-have extras

3. Recommend which pricing model makes more sense for my usage pattern

4. Highlight any dealbreakers or must-have features that eliminate options

5. Suggest whether I should start with a trial/free option or commit to paid service immediately

Please show your math and reasoning for cost calculations.

## Usage Tips

**1. Be Honest About Usage Patterns**:
- Don't estimate - check actual past 3 months if possible
- Include seasonal variations (e.g., "0 in summer, 500 min/month in school term")
- Consider future growth but don't overestimate

**2. Distinguish Required vs. Nice-to-Have**:
- Required = can't work without it
- Nice-to-have = would be useful but not essential
- Focus on must-haves first, then evaluate extras

**3. Include Hidden Costs**:
- Time spent learning new tools
- Migration effort from current service
- Team training requirements
- Integration setup costs

**4. Test Cost Scenarios**:
- Run prompt with minimum expected usage
- Run again with maximum expected usage
- Compare results to see which is more stable

**5. Rerun When Needs Change**:
- Update prompt every 6 months
- Rerun if usage pattern changes significantly
- Validate when considering service switching

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Occasional Podcaster
**Input**:
- 200 minutes/month (4 × 50-minute episodes)
- Usage: Weekly
- Solo creator
- Needs: Speaker ID, subtitle formats (SRT/VTT)
- Budget: $30/month max

**Expected Output**:
- BrassTranscripts cost: $30/month (4 × 50 min × $0.15)
- Subscription service: ~$20-30/month (Personal tier)
- Recommendation: Compare specific subscription prices; BrassTranscripts may cost same but offers more flexibility for variable months

### Scenario 2: Business Team
**Input**:
- 5,000 minutes/month (high volume)
- Usage: Daily meetings
- Team of 8 people
- Needs: Real-time transcription, team collaboration, AI summaries
- Budget: $1,000/month max

**Expected Output**:
- BrassTranscripts cost: $750/month (5,000 × $0.15)
- Subscription service: ~$200-500/month (Business tier with seats)
- Recommendation: Subscription likely better due to real-time requirement and team features

### Scenario 3: Variable Volume User
**Input**:
- 0-500 minutes/month (highly variable)
- Usage: "Some months 0, some months 10+ hours"
- Solo user
- Needs: Just transcription, no extras
- Budget: Minimize costs

**Expected Output**:
- BrassTranscripts cost: $0-75/month (pay only when using)
- Subscription service: $20-30/month (even when not using)
- Recommendation: Pay-per-use significantly better for variable patterns

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Overestimating monthly usage** - Check actual past usage, don't guess
❌ **Confusing wants with needs** - Be honest about must-have features
❌ **Ignoring usage variability** - Account for seasonal changes
❌ **Forgetting to include team size** - Subscription seat costs multiply quickly
❌ **Not considering workflow fit** - Real-time vs. file upload matters
