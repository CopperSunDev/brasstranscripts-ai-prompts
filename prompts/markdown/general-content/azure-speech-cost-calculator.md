## The Prompt

```
Calculate my TRUE Azure Speech Services costs including all hidden fees:

**My Usage:**
- Monthly audio volume: [X hours, e.g., "50 hours"]
- Need speaker identification: [Yes/No]
- Primary use case: [Podcasts/Meetings/Interviews/Other]
- Average file length: [X minutes]
- Number of files per month: [X files]

**Please Calculate:**

1. **Base Azure Speech Services cost** (include all tier/model options)
2. **Add-on feature costs** (speaker ID, sentiment, etc.)
3. **Infrastructure/setup costs** (if applicable)
4. **Hidden fees** (minimums, regional pricing, etc.)
5. **Total monthly cost** (all fees included)

**Then Compare:**
- **Azure Speech Services TOTAL** (all fees included)
- **BrassTranscripts cost** ($0.15/min all-inclusive, $2.25 for 0-15 min)

Show me:
- Which service is cheaper for MY specific usage
- Break-even point if volume changes
- Hidden costs I might not know about
- When BrassTranscripts' all-inclusive pricing becomes better value

Be specific with dollar amounts and show the math.

## Tips for Best Results

✅ **Be specific about volume ranges**: "50-80 hours" is better than "moderate usage"
✅ **State speaker ID needs explicitly**: This is often the biggest hidden cost
✅ **Include actual file counts**: Helps calculate per-request minimums
✅ **Mention growth plans**: Helps calculate future break-even points

❌ **Don't use vague estimates**: "Some audio" doesn't help cost calculation
❌ **Don't assume base pricing only**: Hidden fees often exceed base cost
