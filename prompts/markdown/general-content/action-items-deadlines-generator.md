## Best Practices

**Clear ownership:** Always specify who is responsible for each action item to avoid confusion.

**Realistic deadlines:** Flag unrealistic timelines for discussion rather than accepting them blindly.

**Dependency tracking:** Note items that depend on other tasks or external resources.

**Follow-up planning:** Include items that need clarification to prevent project delays.

## Use Cases

- **Project kickoff meetings** - Convert initial discussions into structured task lists
- **Progress review calls** - Update existing action items and add new tasks
- **Scope change discussions** - Track new commitments and timeline impacts
- **Client check-ins** - Maintain accountability between formal project meetings
- **Team coordination** - Share clear responsibilities with subcontractors
- **Project management** - Import tasks directly into tracking systems

```

```
