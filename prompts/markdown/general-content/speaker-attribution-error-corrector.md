# Speaker Attribution Error Corrector

**Category**: General Content
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Estimated Tokens**: 1200-1800
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Description

While AI achieves 94% speaker identification accuracy, the remaining 6% of errors can confuse readers and misattribute important statements. This prompt systematically identifies and corrects speaker attribution mistakes using context clues, speech patterns, and logical conversation flow.

## The Prompt

```text
I have a transcript with automatic speaker identification that contains some speaker attribution errors. Please help me identify and correct these mistakes systematically:

**Transcript with Speaker Labels:**
[PASTE YOUR TRANSCRIPT HERE]

**Known Speaker Information (if available):**
- Speaker names: [LIST KNOWN PARTICIPANTS]
- Voice characteristics: [DESCRIBE - e.g., "Speaker 1 is female with British accent, Speaker 2 is male with American accent"]
- Context clues: [ANY RELEVANT INFO - e.g., "John is the CEO mentioned in line 45", "Sarah discusses marketing topics"]

Please analyze the transcript and:

1. **Identify Attribution Errors**
   - Find instances where speaker labels switch mid-sentence or mid-thought
   - Detect unnatural speaker changes (e.g., one person asking and answering their own question)
   - Flag conversations where responses don't logically match questions
   - Note any single sentence unrealistically attributed to 3+ different speakers

2. **Detect Pattern-Based Errors**
   - Identify systematic errors (e.g., Speaker 2 and Speaker 3 consistently confused)
   - Find sections where all speakers labeled generically ("Speaker 1, 2, 3") but context reveals names
   - Detect when one speaker's dialogue is split across multiple speaker IDs
   - Note timestamp clusters where speaker switches happen every 2-3 seconds (likely incorrect)

3. **Apply Context-Based Corrections**
   - Use content context (e.g., "As I mentioned earlier" links to previous speaker)
   - Identify speakers through self-references ("Hi, I'm John", "My team and I...")
   - Track topic ownership (technical discussions likely same expert throughout)
   - Recognize response patterns (answering questions logically pairs speakers)

4. **Suggest Systematic Corrections**
   For each error type found, provide:
   - **Error description**: "Speaker 2 and Speaker 3 confused in lines 145-230"
   - **Evidence**: Quote 2-3 specific examples showing the error
   - **Recommended fix**: "All 'Speaker 3' in this section should be 'Speaker 2' based on topic continuity"
   - **Confidence level**: High/Medium/Low based on available evidence

5. **Generate Corrected Version**
   - Provide the fully corrected transcript with accurate speaker labels
   - Highlight major corrections made (e.g., "Consolidated 4 speaker IDs into 2 actual speakers")
   - Flag any sections where attribution remains uncertain for manual review

6. **Create Find-and-Replace Commands**
   If corrections are systematic, provide exact find-and-replace commands:
   - "Replace all 'Speaker 3:' with 'Speaker 2:' in lines 145-230"
   - "Replace 'Speaker 1' with 'John Smith' throughout document"

**Priority**: Focus on errors that significantly impact readability and comprehension. Minor labeling inconsistencies that don't affect meaning can be noted separately.

Please return: (1) Summary of errors found, (2) Specific correction recommendations, (3) Fully corrected transcript, (4) Any uncertain sections flagged for manual review.

## Best Practices

**Provide context:** Any known speaker information (names, roles, voice characteristics) dramatically improves correction accuracy.

**Section processing:** For long transcripts (60+ minutes), process in 15-20 minute sections for more accurate corrections.

**Audio cross-reference:** For high-stakes documents (legal, medical, compliance), verify corrections against original audio.

**Iterative refinement:** Run prompt once for initial corrections, then re-run on corrected version to catch remaining errors.

## Use Cases

- **Multi-speaker meetings** - Fix attribution errors in 4+ person board meetings and team discussions
- **Panel discussions** - Correct confusion in conference panels and roundtable conversations
- **Podcast interviews** - Ensure accurate host/guest attribution for publication
- **Focus groups** - Consolidate and correctly attribute participant responses
- **Legal depositions** - Verify witness/attorney attribution for court records
- **Academic interviews** - Ensure accurate participant attribution for research analysis

## Time Savings

- **Manual speaker error correction**: 30-60 minutes per hour of multi-speaker transcript
- **AI-assisted with this prompt**: 5-10 minutes per hour of transcript
- **Especially valuable**: 4+ speaker meetings, panel discussions, group interviews
