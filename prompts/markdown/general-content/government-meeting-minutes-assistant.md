## Legal Compliance Notes

**IMPORTANT:** AI-generated minutes are drafts only. The government clerk or designated official is responsible for:

- Ensuring compliance with state Open Meetings Act requirements
- Verifying accuracy of all information
- Following jurisdiction-specific formatting standards
- Obtaining official approval from the legislative body
- Maintaining official records per retention requirements

**Most states require minutes to include:**
- Actions taken (motions, resolutions, ordinances)
- Vote results (who voted yes/no/abstained)
- Attendance and quorum status
- Meeting date, time, location

**Most states do NOT require:**
- Verbatim transcripts of discussions
- Complete dialogue or every comment made
- Word-for-word public comment transcription

For specific requirements in your jurisdiction, consult your state's Open Meetings Act or municipal clerk training resources.
