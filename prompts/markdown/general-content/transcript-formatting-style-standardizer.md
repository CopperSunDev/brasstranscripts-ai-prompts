## The Prompt

```text
I have a raw AI-generated transcript that needs professional formatting and style standardization. Please help me apply consistent rules and formatting throughout the document:

**Current Transcript:**
[PASTE YOUR TRANSCRIPT HERE]

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Style preference: [Clean read / Verbatim / Intelligent verbatim]
- Number formatting: [Spell out 1-9, numerals 10+ / All numerals / All spelled out]
- Time format: [12-hour with AM/PM / 24-hour / Spelled out]
- Speaker label format: [Full names / "Speaker 1,2,3" / Role titles]
- Timestamp frequency: [Every paragraph / Every 30 seconds / None / Custom]

Please standardize the following throughout the transcript:

1. **Speaker Labels**
   - Apply consistent format for all speaker identifications
   - Place labels on separate lines before dialogue
   - Ensure no mid-sentence label interruptions

2. **Grammar and Punctuation**
   - Add proper sentence-ending punctuation
   - Insert commas for natural reading flow (not based on pauses)
   - Correct obvious grammatical errors while preserving speaker voice
   - Apply consistent capitalization rules

3. **Number and Time Formatting**
   - Standardize all number representations per style guide
   - Format all time references consistently
   - Add commas to large numbers (1,000 not 1000)

4. **Content Notation**
   - Mark inaudible sections as [inaudible HH:MM:SS]
   - Indicate unclear content as [unclear] or [unclear: best guess?]
   - Note significant non-speech sounds: [laughter], [phone rings]
   - Handle simultaneous speech: [speaking simultaneously]

5. **Technical Terms and Acronyms**
   - Spell out acronyms on first use: Full Name (ACRONYM)
   - Use acronym alone in subsequent references
   - Verify technical term spellings and correct if needed
   - Flag uncertain terminology for manual review

6. **Remove or Clean**
   - Remove excessive filler words ("um," "uh," "like") if clean read style
   - Eliminate false starts and repeated words unless verbatim required
   - Clean up run-on sentences into proper sentence structure
   - Remove irrelevant background conversation or noise

7. **Consistency Checks**
   - Ensure consistent spelling of names, companies, products throughout
   - Verify consistent terminology (don't alternate between synonyms)
   - Apply consistent paragraph breaks at logical conversation points
   - Maintain consistent tense and voice

Please return the fully formatted transcript with all standardizations applied, and provide a brief summary of major changes made (e.g., "Corrected 47 instances of inconsistent speaker labels, standardized 23 number formats, removed 156 filler words").

## Best Practices

**Style guide clarity:** Specify your style preferences clearly (AP Style, Chicago Manual, internal company standards).

**Verbatim requirements:** For legal or medical transcripts, explicitly state verbatim requirements to prevent content removal.

**Sample review:** After first use, review a sample section to verify formatting matches expectations before processing full document.

**Save preferences:** Document your style choices for consistent formatting across multiple transcripts.

## Use Cases

- **Corporate meetings** - Convert raw Zoom transcripts into professionally formatted meeting minutes
- **Podcast transcripts** - Clean up automatic transcription for website publication with proper speaker attribution
- **Research interviews** - Prepare qualitative research transcripts for analysis software
- **Video content** - Format subtitle exports into readable blog posts or documentation
- **Legal proceedings** - Ensure consistent verbatim formatting for deposition transcripts
- **Medical records** - Apply SOAP format standards to clinical interview transcripts

## Time Savings

- **Manual formatting**: 60-90 minutes per hour of transcript
- **AI-assisted with this prompt**: 5-10 minutes per hour of transcript
- **Especially valuable**: 20,000+ word transcripts from conferences or long meetings
