## Description

Extract the most important concepts from lecture transcripts into concise, one-page reference sheets perfect for quick review before exams. Ideal for students who need focused study materials highlighting only the essential information.

## The Prompt

```text
Based on this lecture transcript, create a "Quick Reference Sheet":

1. List the 5-7 most important concepts covered in the lecture
2. Provide a one-sentence definition for each concept
3. Explain why each concept matters (practical application or exam relevance)
4. Identify relationships between concepts (how they connect)
5. Suggest 3-5 additional resources for deeper learning on these concepts
6. Note any areas where the professor gave "exam hint" language

Target: One-page reference sheet students can review the night before an exam.

## Best Practices

**Extreme focus:** Select only the truly essential concepts that are most likely to appear on exams or have the highest practical importance.

**Clarity over detail:** Provide concise definitions that capture the essence without overwhelming students during rapid review.

**Connection emphasis:** Help students understand how concepts relate to each other for deeper comprehension rather than isolated memorization.

**Exam-oriented:** Prioritize content based on professor emphasis, complexity, and likelihood of exam testing.

## Use Cases

- **Pre-exam cramming** - Quick review the night before exams
- **Concept prioritization** - Identify what to study when time is limited
- **Multi-lecture review** - Create reference sheets for each lecture, then review all in sequence
- **Memory refresher** - Quick reference during open-book exams or assignments

## Example Output

### Quick Reference Sheet: Cognitive Development (Lecture 3)

**Course**: PSYCH 101 - Introduction to Psychology
**Exam Format**: Multiple choice + 2 essay questions
**Review Time**: 15-20 minutes

---

### Key Concepts

**1. Schema**
- **Definition**: A cognitive framework that organizes and interprets information based on prior experience
- **Why it matters**: Foundation for understanding how children learn and adapt to new information; likely essay topic
- **Connection**: Directly relates to assimilation and accommodation processes

**2. Assimilation**
- **Definition**: The process of incorporating new experiences into existing schemas without changing those schemas
- **Why it matters**: Explains how children initially understand new objects (calling all four-legged animals "doggie")
- **Connection**: Works alongside accommodation to create cognitive development

**3. Accommodation**
- **Definition**: The process of changing existing schemas or creating new ones when new information doesn't fit
- **Why it matters**: Demonstrates cognitive flexibility and growth (learning "doggie" and "kitty" are different)
- **Connection**: Complement to assimilation; both are mechanisms of adaptation

**4. Object Permanence**
- **Definition**: Understanding that objects continue to exist even when they can't be seen, heard, or touched
- **Why it matters**: Major milestone in sensorimotor stage (8-12 months); professor emphasized "KEY EXAM CONCEPT"
- **Connection**: Demonstrates cognitive advance from sensory-bound thinking

**5. Conservation**
- **Definition**: Understanding that quantity remains the same despite changes in appearance or arrangement
- **Why it matters**: Distinguishes preoperational from concrete operational stage; classic Piaget experiment
- **Connection**: Tests logical thinking development in children

**6. Egocentrism (Cognitive)**
- **Definition**: The inability to take another person's perspective or understand that others may see things differently
- **Why it matters**: Characteristic of preoperational stage (2-7 years); explains social development challenges
- **Connection**: Demonstrated by three-mountain task experiment

**7. Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**
- **Definition**: The gap between what a learner can do independently and what they can do with guidance
- **Why it matters**: Vygotsky's alternative to Piaget; emphasized social/cultural role in development
- **Connection**: Sets up next lecture on sociocultural perspectives

---

### Concept Relationships

- **Schema** is the foundation → **Assimilation** and **Accommodation** are the processes that modify schemas
- **Object Permanence** and **Conservation** are examples of cognitive abilities that develop through schema modification
- **Egocentrism** represents cognitive limitation that decreases as schemas become more sophisticated
- **ZPD** offers alternative framework focusing on social rather than individual development

---

### Exam Hints from Professor

- "Object permanence is a KEY concept you'll definitely see on the midterm" (mentioned 3x during lecture)
- "Make sure you can distinguish assimilation from accommodation with examples" (repeated at lecture end)
- "The conservation task is classic Piaget - understand the logic behind it" (drew on board, took photos)
- "We'll return to Vygotsky next week, but know the basic ZPD concept now"

---

### Additional Resources

1. **Textbook**: Chapter 4, pages 112-145 (Piaget's theory in detail)
2. **Video**: Watch the conservation experiment demonstration (link on Canvas)
3. **Practice**: Complete the Piaget stages chart in study guide (due before next class)
4. **Optional**: Read Vygotsky excerpt (Canvas) for deeper ZPD understanding
5. **Office hours**: Professor available Thursday 2-4pm for concept clarification

---

### Study Strategy

1. Memorize definitions of all 7 concepts (flashcards recommended)
2. Prepare 1-2 examples for each concept showing real-world application
3. Practice explaining assimilation vs. accommodation (most commonly confused)
4. Review conservation experiment video to understand the logic
5. Connect these concepts to developmental stages from Week 1 lecture

**Time investment**: 30-40 minutes for thorough mastery of these concepts
