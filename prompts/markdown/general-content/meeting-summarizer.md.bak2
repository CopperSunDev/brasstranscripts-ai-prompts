## Best Practices

**Speaker tracking:** Use JSON format to automatically identify who said what and assign accountability for action items.

**Time references:** Include timestamps for important decisions using SRT/VTT formats when precision matters.

**Confidentiality:** Always review before sharing to ensure sensitive information is appropriately handled.

**Distribution:** Create different summary levels for different stakeholder groups (executive summary vs. detailed team summary).

## Use Cases

- **Team meetings** - Weekly standups, sprint planning, retrospectives
- **Client calls** - Project updates, requirement discussions, feedback sessions
- **Board meetings** - Strategic discussions, quarterly reviews, governance decisions
- **Project meetings** - Status updates, milestone reviews, problem-solving sessions
- **Sales meetings** - Prospect calls, deal reviews, pipeline discussions
- **Training sessions** - Workshop summaries, knowledge transfer, skill development

Please create a comprehensive summary that uses speaker attribution from JSON and timestamps from SRT for key decisions.
```

**Stakeholder-specific summaries:** Request different summary levels:

2. Detailed summary (full format above) for project team
```

**Follow-up automation:** Add tracking elements:
```text
Additionally, please create:

```
