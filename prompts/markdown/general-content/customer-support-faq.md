### Customer Support Documentation: Transcription Service FAQ

**FAQ Section**

**Q: Why is my transcription accuracy lower than expected?**
**A:** Transcription accuracy depends primarily on audio quality. To improve accuracy:
1. Use a good quality microphone (USB or external mic recommended)
2. Record in a quiet environment with minimal background noise
3. Speak clearly at a normal pace
4. Ensure the audio file is not corrupted or compressed heavily
5. For best results, aim for audio quality at 44.1kHz sample rate or higher

If you've followed these guidelines and still experience issues, contact our support team with your audio file for analysis.

**Q: Which transcript format should I choose for my project?**
**A:** Format selection depends on your intended use:
- **TXT:** Choose for clean content creation, blog posts, or document writing
- **JSON:** Select when you need speaker identification or metadata analysis
- **SRT/VTT:** Use for video projects requiring subtitles or timestamp references

You can also download multiple formats to test which works best for your workflow.

**Q: How long does it take to process my audio file?**
**A:** Processing times vary by file length and current system load:
- Files under 30 minutes: Usually 5-15 minutes
- Files 30-60 minutes: Typically 15-30 minutes
- Files over 60 minutes: May take 30-60 minutes

You'll receive an email notification when your transcript is ready. Large files (over 2 hours) may take longer during peak usage times.

**Q: Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied with the transcription quality?**
**A:** Yes, we offer a satisfaction guarantee:
1. Contact support within 7 days of transcript delivery
2. Provide specific examples of accuracy issues
3. Include the original audio file for review
4. Our team will either reprocess your file or provide a full refund

Note: Refunds aren't available for poor audio quality that cannot be improved through reprocessing.

**Common Issues and Solutions**

**Problem Category:** Low Transcription Accuracy
- **Resolution Process:**
  1. Check original audio quality (clear speech, minimal background noise)
  2. Verify file format is supported (WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC recommended)

  4. Request reprocessing if audio quality is good
- **Prevention Tips:** Use quality recording equipment, test audio before long recordings
- **Escalation:** Contact support if accuracy is below 90% with good quality audio

**Problem Category:** Missing Speaker Identification
- **Resolution Process:**
  1. Verify you selected JSON format for download

- **Prevention Tips:** Use JSON format, record with clear speaker separation
- **Escalation:** Contact support for manual speaker identification assistance

**Problem Category:** File Upload Failures
- **Resolution Process:**
  1. Check file size (maximum 2GB per file)
  2. Verify file format is supported
