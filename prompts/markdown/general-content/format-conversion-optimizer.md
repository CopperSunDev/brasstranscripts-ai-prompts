**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Estimated Tokens**: 600-900
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Description

Convert between transcript formats (TXT, SRT, VTT, JSON) while optimizing for specific use cases and maintaining quality. Perfect for adapting transcripts to different platforms, workflows, and technical requirements without losing content accuracy or readability.

## The Prompt

```text
I have a transcript in [SOURCE FORMAT] that I need to convert to [TARGET FORMAT] for [SPECIFIC USE CASE].

Source Format: [TXT/SRT/VTT/JSON]
Target Format: [TXT/SRT/VTT/JSON]
Use Case: [YouTube upload / Website embedding / AI analysis / Documentation]

Please convert the transcript while:
1. Preserving all content accuracy
2. Optimizing timing for readability (if applicable)
3. Adding proper formatting for the target platform
4. Following best practices for [TARGET FORMAT]
5. Maintaining speaker identification if present

Additional Requirements:
- Subtitle duration: [2-3 seconds per caption / custom timing]
- Reading speed: [15-20 characters per second / custom]
- Styling needs: [Basic / Advanced CSS / None]
- Character encoding: [UTF-8 / other]

Here's the source transcript:
[PASTE YOUR TRANSCRIPT HERE]

Please provide the converted transcript ready for immediate use.
```

## Best Practices

**Format Selection:** Choose target format based on platform requirements—SRT for universal compatibility, VTT for HTML5, JSON for programmatic use.

**Timing Optimization:** When converting to SRT/VTT, ensure subtitles maintain 15-20 characters per second reading speed.

**Metadata Preservation:** Maintain speaker labels and timestamps when converting between formats.

**Quality Validation:** Always test converted files on target platform before final deployment.

## Use Cases

- **Video Platform Migration** - Convert SRT subtitles to VTT for HTML5 video players
- **AI Workflow Integration** - Transform TXT transcripts to JSON for programmatic processing
- **Archive Simplification** - Convert complex JSON data to clean TXT documentation
- **Multi-Platform Distribution** - Generate all formats from single source for maximum compatibility
- **Accessibility Compliance** - Convert between formats to meet WCAG requirements
- **Developer Integration** - Transform human-readable formats to API-ready JSON

## Technical Notes

### SRT → VTT Conversion
1. Add "WEBVTT" header as first line
2. Replace comma with period in timestamps (00:00:00,000 → 00:00:00.000)
3. Optionally add styling blocks for advanced formatting

### JSON → TXT Conversion
1. Extract text from segments sequentially
2. Add speaker labels if present in metadata
3. Format with logical paragraphs and sections

### TXT → SRT/VTT Conversion
1. Estimate timing based on word count and speech pace
2. Break text at natural phrase boundaries
3. Maintain 2-3 second display duration per subtitle

## Example Workflow

**Input (TXT):**
```
Speaker 1: Welcome to today's discussion about AI transcription formats.
Speaker 2: Thanks for having me. The key difference between formats is their intended use case.
```

**Output (SRT):**
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome to today's discussion
about AI transcription formats.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,200
Thanks for having me. The key difference
between formats is their intended use case.
