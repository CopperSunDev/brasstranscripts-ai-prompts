- **Timestamp**: 3:42:15
- **Type**: Gaming philosophy

**Instagram Caption**:
"💡 Plot twist: All those deaths weren't failures, they were tuition payments 💰

Seriously though, some of the best lessons in gaming (and life) come from spectacular failures. Each death teaches you something new about the game, about your limits, about what not to do next time.

What's the most valuable lesson a game ever taught you? Not just about the game itself, but about persistence, problem-solving, or patience?

**Instagram Caption**:
"🔥 Dropping a controversial opinion today...

'If you need a guide to enjoy a game, maybe it's not a good game.'

Okay hear me out before you riot in my comments! I'm not talking about complex strategy games or learning mechanics. I mean when you literally can't have fun without following someone else's exact playthrough.

Good games should be intuitive enough that discovery feels rewarding, not frustrating. What do you think? Am I completely wrong here?
