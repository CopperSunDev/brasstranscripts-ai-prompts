Transform this meeting transcript into a comprehensive summary for distributed team members who couldn't attend. Structure the output for async consumption:

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** (3-4 sentences maximum)
[Key decisions, major outcomes, critical action items]

**PARTICIPANTS & TIMEZONES**
[List each speaker with their role and timezone, note if they left early/joined late]

**DECISIONS MADE**
[Specific decisions with context and rationale]

**ACTION ITEMS**
[Owner name, specific task, deadline, dependencies]

**DISCUSSION CONTEXT**
[Background information, assumptions, alternatives considered]

**QUESTIONS FOR ASYNC TEAM**
[Specific questions requiring input from team members not present]

**NEXT STEPS**
[Timeline, next meeting, required approvals]

Focus on providing enough context for team members to contribute meaningfully to follow-up discussions without needing to watch/listen to the entire recording.

## Best Practices

**Include timezone context:** Always note participant timezones to help async team members understand when decisions were made and plan their responses accordingly.

**Prioritize actionable items:** Lead with decisions and action items since these require the most immediate attention from absent team members.

**Preserve discussion context:** Include the reasoning behind decisions so team members can provide informed input even without attending.

**Flag urgent items clearly:** Mark any time-sensitive items that require response within 24-48 hours.

## Use Cases

- **Daily standups for global teams** - Keep distributed teammates aligned without requiring everyone to attend live
- **Project status meetings** - Document progress updates for stakeholders in different timezones
- **Decision-making sessions** - Capture context for team members to review and provide async input
- **Client meetings** - Share outcomes with internal teams who couldn't attend
- **All-hands meetings** - Create searchable summaries for employees who missed company announcements
