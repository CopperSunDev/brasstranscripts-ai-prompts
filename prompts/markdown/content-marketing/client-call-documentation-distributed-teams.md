## Best Practices

**Capture direct quotes:** Include exact client feedback and concerns to preserve context for team members who weren't on the call.

**Assign clear ownership:** Each action item should have a specific owner, deadline, and any dependencies on other team members.

**Note client preferences:** Track communication style preferences and concerns for future interactions.

**Highlight scope changes:** Clearly flag any modifications that affect timeline, budget, or resource allocation.

## Use Cases

- **Client status updates** - Keep project teams informed about client interactions without requiring everyone on calls
- **Account management** - Document relationship details for handoffs between account managers
- **Sales follow-up** - Transform discovery calls into actionable documentation for proposal teams
- **Support escalations** - Document client issues for technical teams to review and address
- **Stakeholder briefings** - Provide leadership with client relationship status
