## Best Practices

**Structure for scanning:** Distributed team members often need to quickly find relevant information. Use consistent formatting and clear headers.

**Include timezone conversions:** Convert all mentioned times to multiple timezones used by your team (e.g., PST, EST, GMT, IST).

**Highlight handoff opportunities:** Identify work that can be passed between team members in different timezones to maximize productivity.

**Separate urgent from routine:** Clearly distinguish items needing immediate attention from standard updates.

## Use Cases

- **Daily standups for remote teams** - Transform synchronous standups into async-friendly documentation
- **Sprint planning updates** - Keep distributed Agile teams aligned on sprint progress
- **Project team coordination** - Document daily progress for stakeholders and team members
- **Follow-the-sun workflows** - Enable seamless handoffs between teams in different regions
- **Manager briefings** - Provide leadership with structured team status without requiring attendance
